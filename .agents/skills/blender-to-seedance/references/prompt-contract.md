# Video-lock prompt contract

The blockout prompt dresses the world; the previz owns motion, camera, cuts, and
timing. Ten blocks, in order. Fill every `<placeholder>`; drop a block only when
the shot genuinely has no content for it.

## Template

```text
ACTIVE REFERENCES
@Video 1 = <previz role: blocking master, 30s, frame-aligned>. It defines the
ENTIRE camera path, cut timing, blocking, and the position/role of every figure.
It is the SOLE authority for motion and placement. Do NOT take material,
texture, color, lighting, or set design from it.
@Image 1 = <Subject A>. Defines <identity/wardrobe/structure> only. Pose,
background, and lighting not inherited.
@Image 2 = <location or style>. Defines <materials, palette, mood> only. Camera
angle and composition not inherited.

VIDEO LOCK
Every output frame corresponds 1:1 to the same-timestamp frame of @Video 1:
same camera, framing, cuts, object positions and trajectories. If any text in
this prompt disagrees with @Video 1 about motion, framing, direction, timing, or
placement, @Video 1 wins. Re-dress, never re-imagine: no added, dropped, merged,
or re-timed shots.

DUMMY MAPPING
Sphere dummies are always people. The <red box> = <hero>. Colored proxies =
<identity by color>. <cabin blocks> = <luggage>. The <low-poly flyer> =
<helicopter>. Proxies give position, scale, and motion only, never surface or
design.

LOCATION MAP
<Location 1> 00:00-00:06.7. <Location 2> 00:06.7-00:13.3. Each location appears
exactly once; a dark dip / hard reset = transition to the NEXT location, never a
replay.

RULES
Exactly <N subjects>, and only <N>. They attack one at a time, in order. <Falls
at 12 / 13 / 14 / 16 / 20 / 26s — one man per fall>. The downed stay down.
Nobody enters frame except where @Video 1 stages an entrance.

ACTION TIMING
<stage 1 (0-8s)>: <one event + visible end state>.
<stage 2 (8-12s)>: <one event + visible end state>.
<final stage>: <closing event + final visible state>.

DIALOGUE NEVER CREATES SHOTS
Spoken lines happen inside @Video 1's takes exactly as blocked — no cutaways, no
reverse shots, no new close-ups. A line marked off-screen stays off-screen.

ENDING LOCK
The film ends on @Video 1's final frame. The last five seconds follow the source
exactly.

AUDIO
[Sound design] <ambience bed>.
[Timed accents] <one impact each at 12 / 13 / 14 / 16 / 20 / 26s>.
[Dialogue] <verbatim lines, with forbidden-phrase list where relevant>.

HOLD FOR THE FULL TIMELINE
@Video 1 camera path 1:1. <Countable rules repeated>. <Identity> constant.
<World> in every frame; no subtitles, no watermarks.
```

## Fill rules

- **ACTIVE REFERENCES** — each entry says what it defines AND what it does not
  inherit. A sheet that says only "reference" is under-specified.
- **VIDEO LOCK** — always name the exact correspondence ("1:1", "frame-aligned")
  and the tiebreak ("the video wins"). This is the block that stops the model
  re-choreographing.
- **DUMMY MAPPING** — the model must never guess which proxy is which subject.
- **LOCATION MAP** — timestamps make "seven locations, each once" enforceable.
- **RULES** — only numbers the model can count. Avoid vibes; use counts and
  orders.
- **ACTION TIMING** — one primary event + one visible end state per stage; end
  states carry running counts ("bodies 4, all behind him").
- **DIALOGUE NEVER CREATES SHOTS** — critical for multi-character scenes; the
  model's reflex is to cut to the speaker.
- **ENDING LOCK** — prevents the model inventing a new closing shot.
- **AUDIO** — SFX only unless the user asked for music/dialogue; accents align
  to the same timestamps as ACTION TIMING.
- **HOLD** — the compact seal that re-pins video lock, counts, identity, and
  world against late drift.

## Style swap (car-commercial pattern)

When one previz renders in multiple styles, keep the structural blocks identical
(VIDEO LOCK, DUMMY MAPPING, LOCATION MAP, ACTION TIMING, ENDING LOCK) and swap
only the dressing blocks: ACTIVE REFERENCES (style master vs. atmosphere
master), the world/materials descriptions, and AUDIO. The structure never
changes; only the skin does.
