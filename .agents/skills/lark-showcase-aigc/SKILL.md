description: Orchestrates ffmpeg-scene-transitions, lark-demo-doc-builder, lark-doc, lark-wiki, lark-drive, and design-doc-mermaid to build enterprise-facing Lark documents that showcase AIGC (AI-generated content) with prompts, results, and inline media. When the showcase spans multiple locked videos, assemble them into one compilation highlight video first (via ffmpeg-scene-transitions), then place the compilation at the top of the document in an initial "Production Overview & Capabilities Matrix" + "Highlight Video" section. Invoke when the user wants a standalone customer guide or showcase article in Lark.

# Showcase AIGC

Create a polished external-facing Lark Document that combines two goals at once:

1. **Showcase** what was produced and why it matters.
2. **Teach** the reader how the workflow works step by step.

Use this skill when the user wants a customer-ready Lark document that feels like a strong product article or breakdown page similar in spirit to a Higgsfield workflow post, but adapted for enterprise readers and delivered as a Lark Document.

## Primary outcome

Produce a **standalone external guide** that a client can read without any access to the local workspace, repository, or project folder. The document must stand on its own.

The final document should:

- open with the strongest result or business outcome before the detailed walkthrough;
- explain the business scenario and outcome clearly;
- walk through the workflow in a logical tutorial sequence;
- show the exact prompts, references, settings, and outputs that matter;
- embed images, audio, and video inline when available;
- read like a polished customer showcase, not an internal engineering note.

## Orchestration

This skill is an orchestrator — it sequences these skills and tools as needed:

- `ffmpeg-scene-transitions` to assemble multiple locked scene videos into one
  compilation highlight video (with crossfades and locked A/V sync) before
  building the document.
- `lark-demo-doc-builder` for the main document-building workflow and prompt/result table patterns.
- `lark-doc` for document creation and block-level editing.
- `lark-wiki` when the target is a wiki URL and the underlying doc token must be resolved.
- `lark-drive` when folder placement, permissions, or document organization is requested.
- `design-doc-mermaid` when a workflow diagram materially improves clarity.

Before writing to Lark, follow the upstream Lark instructions required by `lark-demo-doc-builder`.

## External-guide rules

This skill is for **client-facing artifacts**, so enforce these rules strictly unless the user explicitly asks otherwise:

- Do **not** mention local files, local paths, repo paths, folder names, asset filenames, shell commands, or workspace structure.
- Do **not** say things like "stored in", "saved at", "located in", or reference internal directories.
- Do **not** expose internal-only notes, debugging context, temporary constraints, or implementation caveats irrelevant to the customer.
- Do **not** present the workflow as dependent on this specific machine or repository.
- Do **not** include raw MCP, API, or CLI details unless the user explicitly wants a technical appendix.

Translate internal provenance into customer-safe wording:

- "reference image supplied to the model"
- "generated storyboard frame"
- "generated video result"
- "voice prompt"
- "workflow step"
- "model configuration"

Never surface filesystem-oriented phrasing in the Lark document.

## Detailed authoring references

Load the applicable layout/content reference for the requested edit. Read the
pre-publish verification and standalone-document checks before any authorized
publication. Existing approval to draft does not authorize external messages.
