## Pre-publish verification gate

Before declaring the document complete, run this mandatory scan:

1. **Fetch every section** of the document using `lark-cli docs +fetch --scope
   section --detail with-ids`.
2. **Strip all `<pre>` blocks** from the fetched content — prompt code blocks
   are exempt from the jargon check.
3. **Scan the remaining text** for every term in the jargon blocklist above.
   A simple approach:
   ```bash
   # After fetching a section's JSON, strip code blocks and check for terms
   python3 -c "
   import re
   text = '<fetched content>'
   outside = re.sub(r'<pre[^>]*>.*?</pre>', '', text, flags=re.S)
   visible = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', ' ', outside)
   terms = ['FFmpeg','dreamina-','dola-','generate_audio','reference_audio',
            'native audio','forward extension','720p','24fps','.wav','.mp4',
            's01_','sh0','_t01','_v0','text-to-image','text-to-audio',
            'variants','canonical','Element sheet','reference sheet',
            'muxed','CLI','MCP','@Audio','@Image','@Video']
   found = [t for t in terms if t.lower() in visible.lower()]
   print('JARGON FOUND:' if found else 'CLEAN', found)
   "
   ```
4. **Fix every hit** using `lark-cli docs +update --command str_replace` to
   replace the jargon with the reader-safe alternative from the blocklist.
5. **Re-fetch and re-scan** after fixes to confirm zero remaining hits.
6. **Table layout verification.** Additionally, verify all media tables meet these layout rules:
   - **Media column is rightmost.** For every table containing images, video, or audio, confirm that the media column (containing `<img>`, `<source>` with video/audio mime type) is the **last column** in the table. The reading order should be: metadata → prompt → result (generated asset last). Prompt is second-to-last, immediately adjacent to its result.
   - **Media columns are the widest.** Video columns should be ~520 px, image columns ~380 px, audio columns ~280 px, and the prompt/code column second-widest (see Column width presets above).
   - **Prompts are wrapped in `<pre><code>` blocks.** Every table cell containing a generation prompt must use `<pre lang="text"><code>...</code></pre>`. Raw prompt text directly in a `<td>` is a formatting error.
   - **No horizontal overflow.** Total column widths should sum to approximately 1020 px or less to fit Lark's wide-mode canvas.

   Fix any violations before declaring the document complete. Use `block_replace` on the table's block ID to update the full table XML with corrected `<colgroup>` widths or missing `<pre><code>` wrapping.
7. **Only then** declare the document complete in the deliverable contract.

This gate is not optional. The "mom test" means: if you handed this document to
someone with no knowledge of AI tooling, API parameters, or internal project
structure, would they understand every word outside the prompt code blocks?
