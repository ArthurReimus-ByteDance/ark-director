## Keyframes, storyboards, and blockouts

These are specialized prompt grammars, not automatic input eligibility. Translate
control-only drawings to text and omit them by default. An intentional storyboard,
sketch, or blockout conditioning path requires explicit user-selected inputs,
current canonical hashes, a compatible live tool mode, and artifact-specific QA.
A declared motion-master reference remains a selected conditioning input, not a
shortcut around review. Image text cannot itself enable an unsupported API role.

### First and last frames in R2V mode

State `@Image 1 is the first frame` and `@Image 2 is the last frame` directly in
multimodal reference mode only when current tool evidence supports this grammar
and ordered image-role combination. This text does not override API constraints.
For supported first-frame modes, the system locks
the aspect ratio to the first image. First and last images **must share the same
aspect ratio**.

- Describe each anchor image **separately** — do not combine into one sentence.
- Additional references supplement **only** their specified attributes and must
  **not** replace the first/last-frame composition.

```
@Image 1 is the first frame. It defines the opening composition, subject position, pose, prop
state, scene, and camera direction.
@Image 2 is the last frame. It defines the ending composition, subject position, pose, prop
state, scene, and camera direction.
@Image 3 defines <Subject A>'s <appearance, clothing, structure, or material>. Do not change
the first-frame composition defined by @Image 1 or the last-frame composition defined by @Image 2.

<Describe one continuous action or event>.
The video begins naturally from the first frame and reaches the last frame after the continuous action.
Between the first and last frames, maintain continuity in <character identity, prop structure and
ownership, scene layout, and camera direction>.
```

### Multi-keyframe sequences

When separate images define different stages:

```
Use @Image 1 through @Image N as keyframes in this order.

@Image 1 is the first frame. It defines <opening composition>.
@Image 2 defines the second keyframe: <visible end state of Stage 1>.
@Image 3 defines the third keyframe: <visible end state of Stage 2>.
@Image N is the last frame. It defines <ending composition>.

The video passes through the states defined by @Image 1, @Image 2, @Image 3, and @Image N in
order, using continuous action to transition naturally between stages.
Maintain continuity in <subject identity, prop structure and ownership, scene layout, lighting,
and axis of action> throughout.
```

> Independent keyframe images are easier to align than grids. They control stage
> order and key states; they do **not** reproduce every frame exactly.

### Storyboard grids

- Communicate overall story, shot order, and approximate compositions — **not strict reproduction**.
- **Prefer ≤ 15 panels.** Use clean line art or simple diagrams; minimize text labels.
- State the reading order, then describe each panel.

```
@Image 1 provides an <N-panel storyboard grid> for shot order and approximate composition.
Read it <left to right, top to bottom>. Do not use the grid's <line-art style, text labels, or
placeholder characters>.
@Image 2 defines <Subject A>'s <appearance and clothing>.

Shot 1: <shot size, subject action, and scene state>.
Shot 2: <shot size, subject action, camera movement, or transition>.
...
Shot N: <closing action and final visible state>.

The final video uses <visual style>. Audio includes <dialogue, ambience, action sound effects, or music>.
```

> **Optional monochrome conditioning.** A sketch remains control-only unless
> the user explicitly selects it for a supported conditioning mode. Omit it by
> default and express scene order, positions, and motion in text. If deliberately
> attached, bind its index, reading order, and limited composition role; state
> the desired final style positively and inspect the output for lines, labels,
> colors, or paper texture leaking into the video. A style override reduces
> ambiguity but does not guarantee that the board's appearance is suppressed.

### Blockout references

Two categories — first determine whether the blockout is a **motion skeleton**
(coarse) or a **complete model** (fine):

| Type | Best For | Material Requirements | Prompt Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Coarse blockout** | Simple geometry previewing action, paths, blocking, camera, or cuts | Clear relationships between shapes and a complete action sequence; character/prop/scene images may be added | Map every blockout subject; state which temporal/spatial info to inherit |
| **Fine blockout** | Complete modeling needing new materials, colors, scenes, or style | Complete, clean model; avoid path lines, coordinate axes, camera frustums | Preserve structure, action, and camera treatment; define attributes to re-render |

**Coarse blockout** — lock action paths, motion direction, blocking,
entrances/exits, camera paths, cut points, lighting changes, and sound rhythm.
Map each geometric object to its final subject.

| Blockout Information | What to State |
|---|---|
| Path | Action trajectory, motion direction, subject blocking, entrance/exit order |
| Camera movement | Camera position, path, direction, speed changes |
| Lighting | Light direction, brightness changes, when changes occur |
| Cuts | Cut positions and the subject/composition before and after each cut |
| Audio | Whether to inherit dialogue, music, ambience, or action SFX |

```
@Video 1 is a coarse blockout reference. It provides only <motion paths, subject blocking, camera
position, camera movement, cuts, lighting changes, sound rhythm, or spatial relationships>.
Do not use its blockout appearance, materials, or scene.
<Blockout Subject A> in @Video 1 corresponds to <Subject A>.
@Image 1 defines <Subject A>'s <appearance, clothing, or structure>.

<Subject> completes <primary action or event> in <scene>.
Keep <motion path, blocking, camera movement, cuts, lighting, or sound rhythm> from @Video 1.
The final video uses <characters, scene, materials, and visual style>. Audio includes <dialogue,
ambience, or action sound effects>.
```

**Fine blockout** — already contains complete structures. Keep it clean: remove
path lines, coordinate axes, controllers, camera frustums.

```
@Video 1 is a fine blockout reference. Preserve <subject structure, action, spatial layout, camera
position, camera movement, and cuts>. Do not use its original gray materials or empty background.
@Image 1 defines <subject>'s <character appearance, material, color, or surface details>.
@Image 2 defines <scene>'s <space, materials, lighting, or visual style>.

Re-render <subject> from @Video 1 as <final subject>, and re-render the scene as <final scene>.
Keep <structure, action, camera treatment, and spatial relationships> from @Video 1.
Use <materials, colors, and style>. Audio includes <ambience, sound effects, or music>.
```

> Prefer simple geometry with clear relationships. Arms, wings, and other
> appendages should be used only when the action sequence is complete;
> otherwise they may cause stiff motion or structural misinterpretation.

**Video-lock blockout** — when the blockout is a complete animated render that
must drive the output frame for frame (camera, cuts, blocking, and timing), use
this master mode instead of coarse/fine. The blockout is the sole authority for
motion and placement; it never supplies appearance. For the end-to-end Blender
build → previz render → submit flow, the `blender-to-seedance` pipeline skill
covers the submission path.

```
@Video 1 is the blocking master. It defines the full edit — every cut point,
camera position, angle, move, and framing, and the motion state and placement of
every object — and is the SOLE authority for motion. Every output frame
corresponds 1:1 to the same-timestamp frame of @Video 1; if text and video
disagree about motion, the video wins. Do not use its gray surfaces, placeholder
colors, or proxy shapes.
@Image 1 defines <subject>'s <appearance, clothing, or structure>.
@Image 2 defines <scene>'s <materials, lighting, or visual style>.

Re-dress, never re-imagine: keep <cuts, camera, blocking, timing> from @Video 1
exactly; no added, dropped, merged, or re-timed shots. Use <characters, scene,
materials, and style>. Audio includes <dialogue, ambience, or action SFX>.
