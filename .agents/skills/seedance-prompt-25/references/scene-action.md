## Scene staging

When a video contains several events, divide the story into **consecutive
stages**. Give each stage only **one primary state change** and a **clear end
state** — what should be directly visible at the end.

**Generate per scene at its natural duration (4–30s), not per 30-second block.**
Right-size each scene using the `duration` parameter — 7s for a single beat,
12s for a short dialogue exchange, 20s for a multi-stage action sequence. Do
not pad scenes to fill 30s. Chain approved scenes via `return_last_frame` /
`first_frame` and assemble in post. Add a shared reference bundle only when
the selected live tool/model explicitly supports mixed frame/reference roles;
a chaining recipe never overrides input compatibility.

```
[Generation Goal]
Generate a <video type>. The central subject is <subject>, and the primary event is <story summary>.

[Stage 1]
Initial state: <initial state of characters, props, and scene>.
Primary event: <one primary action or event>.
End state: <character positions, prop ownership, or visible scene state>.

[Stage 2]
Continue from the previous stage: <state that must remain unchanged>.
Primary event: <one primary action or event>.
End state: <observable state>.

[Stage 3]
Primary event: <closing event>.
End state: <final visible state>.

[Maintain Consistency]
Keep <character identity, number of characters, clothing, prop ownership, spatial direction,
and audio relationships> consistent.
```

### When to use 30s single-pass or native extension (exception)

Native extension (up to 180s, beta) and full 30s single-pass are the **exception**,
not the default. Use them only when you explicitly need continuous, seamless
motion across what would otherwise be scene boundaries:

- **Single continuous take** — a one-shot with no cuts where seamless motion
  across 30s+ matters more than per-scene iteration control.
- **Minimal scene variation** — same location, same characters, gradual change
  that the model handles well in one pass.
- **Audio-driven long dialogue** — one long dialogue block where lip-sync must
  be continuous across scene boundaries; extension keeps it seamless.

If using extension: generate a 30s base take, then extend it forward/backward
in rounds — **do not force scene changes at every 30s mark**; scene changes
happen naturally where the story needs them.

- **Audio with extension (only when separate lip-sync audio is requested).**
  Align a single Seed Audio master to the full timeline
  (up to ~2 min) and pass it as `reference_audio` so dialogue and sound stay
  continuous across the extension.
- **Validate seams.** Extension boundaries are not pixel-identical; inspect the
  boundary image, motion trend, and audio continuity on both sides of each seam.
  Multi-round extension is beta — validate each seam before committing.
- **Aspect ratio** is locked to the input video's ratio for extended segments.

### Timestamps and pacing

Use stages by default. Use one-second precision **only** for critical handoffs,
entrances/exits, transitions, or explicit beats.

| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Time range | `0-3 seconds... 3-7 seconds... 7-12 seconds...` |
| Exact time point | `At 5 seconds, the camera whip-pans rapidly to the left.` |
| Relative timing | `Three seconds after the character presses the button, the lights dim.` |

Rules:
- Time ranges must be **consecutive and non-overlapping**.
- They are a **time budget**, not a precise edit point — actions may occur slightly before or after a boundary.
- Too little content gives the model too much freedom; too much causes excessive cutting or omitted events.
- **Never** demand impossible frequencies (e.g., "complete three actions in one second").

## Action description

The Action slot is the only required part of the six-part formula. Write it as
granular, physical motion — not as a bare verb. "She enters the lab" is open to
interpretation; "she steps through the doorway, shifts her weight onto the
front foot, and scans the room left to right" is testable.

- **Body-part level.** Describe hands, arms, legs, head, shoulders, back, hips,
  and feet with range, speed, and force.
- **Physics grounding.** State where weight and balance sit, what stays planted,
  and what the body pushes against or reacts to: ground contact, momentum
  through a turn, inertia carried between actions.
- **Prefer slow, gentle, continuous motion.** "Slowly raise a hand," "gently
  lower the head," "naturally sit down."
- **Avoid high-burst, large-dynamic actions** — sprinting, big jumps, violent
  rolls — unless the shot explicitly requires them.
- **Describe transitions between actions** for continuity: "use the inertia of
  turning around to naturally raise a hand."
- **Externalize emotions as physical detail**, never bare emotion labels. Use
  the [Emotional direction](audio-performance-camera.md#emotional-direction) cues below.
- **Stay inside the stage budget.** Detail only the movements critical to the
  stage; one primary state change per stage.

### Motion grammar (why a shot reads "static")

A prompt that names *what* moves but not *how* it moves produces a static take.
For every moving element — subjects, props, effects, light, background — write
the full motion grammar, not a bare verb:

| Axis | Question to answer |
|---|---|
| **Motion type** | translate / rotate / scale / parallax / drift / float-bob / pulse / flicker / color-cycle / twinkle / shimmer / sway / wave / slide / zoom / rotation |
| **Direction** | up/down, left/right, toward/away, clockwise/counterclockwise, along what axis |
| **Speed** | slow / medium / fast, or a frequency (e.g. "~0.5Hz sway") |
| **Amplitude** | how far ("~5% of body height", "full spectrum cycle") |
| **Easing** | constant / sinusoidal / accelerating / smooth |
| **Loop period** | how often it repeats ("~2s per cycle"), or "continuous" |

Also state **camera motion explicitly** — including when the camera is truly
static and only elements/light move (very common in stylized animation) — and
**light/color motion** (pulse, strobe, flicker, hue cycle, bloom, shimmer) with
its rate.

Example: instead of "the neon figure floats, a rainbow beam shines from its
head", write "the featureless neon figure floats with a gentle up-down bob
(~0.5Hz sine, ~5% of body height) in a leaning pose, while a fan-shaped rainbow
beam projects from its head with the color bands continuously scrolling along
the beam (~1s full-spectrum cycle) and the background stars twinkle randomly."
