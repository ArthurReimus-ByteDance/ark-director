# Seedance Prompt

Write production-grade prompts for the BytePlus Seedance 2.5 video generation
model. Seedance 2.5 generates **up to 30 seconds** of video with native audio in
a single pass (set the actual duration via the `duration` parameter — 30s is
the ceiling, not the target), accepts up to **50 multimodal reference
materials**, and supports video editing, extension, one-click video, and
seamless transitions. The model co-generates audio and video in one latent
space, so sound direction in the prompt shapes the final result.


## Input and output contract

Input: a video brief, resolved model/operation, duration policy, ordered input roles, and approved relevant Elements.

Output: a six-part prompt, reference bindings, and applicable mode parameters.

## Procedure and reference loading

Use reference-inputs for R2V; video-editing for edits; video-extension for extensions; keyframes-storyboards-blockouts for approved visual conditioning. Add audio-performance-camera only for applicable dialogue, acting, UI, or camera detail.

Read only the mode-specific resources needed for the request. Reference paths
mentioned in prose are relative to this skill directory unless a link says otherwise.

- [Reference Inputs](references/reference-inputs.md) — Reference materials; Multi-reference workflow (5 steps).
- [Scene Action](references/scene-action.md) — Scene staging; Action description.
- [Audio Performance Camera](references/audio-performance-camera.md) — Special audio and text syntax; Emotional direction; Scripted dialogue for all speaking characters; Describing screen and UI layout positively; Camera language; Video call scenes; Spatial continuity.
- [Video Editing](references/video-editing.md) — Video editing.
- [Video Extension](references/video-extension.md) — Video extension.
- [Keyframes Storyboards Blockouts](references/keyframes-storyboards-blockouts.md) — Keyframes, storyboards, and blockouts.
- [Transitions And One Click](references/transitions-and-one-click.md) — One-click video; Seamless video transitions.
- [Repair Examples](references/repair-examples.md) — Read after specific identity or geography feedback; hypothetical minimal repairs and tradeoffs.
- [Worked Examples](references/worked-examples.md) — Full example: T2V 30-second one-take; Full example: R2V multi-reference concert; Full example: Video editing — subject replacement.
- [Parameter Reference](references/parameter-reference.md) — Quick reference card; Guide disclaimer.

## Submission boundary and failure behavior

The caller owns production authorization, the exact request preflight, and the
complete hash-bound prompt review. A leaf returns its prompt package without
loading sibling skills. An explicitly declared orchestrator may coordinate the
review and submission stages. Missing required inputs remain unresolved; a draft
or technical success does not establish user approval. Preserve optional timing,
the three-image sampling default where applicable, and the requested delta.

## Evidence and creative advice

Distinguish four kinds of guidance when they affect a decision: **API requirement**
(verify with the selected live tool and its current source), **documented prompting
convention** (attribute to the linked guide), **observed result** (identify the
actual artifact, model and conditions), and **optional artistic technique**
(a hypothesis or choice to test). Model/price tables are reference snapshots,
not live capability evidence. Examples without linked result evidence are
hypothetical; do not describe them as proven improvements. Keep these labels in
reasoning or evaluation notes when useful, not boilerplate in every final prompt.

## Source authority

The prompt structure and rules in this skill are sourced from the official
Dreamina Seedance 2.5 Prompt Guide:
- [Seedance 2.5 Prompt Guide (Lark)](https://bytedance.larkoffice.com/docx/A88jd0B47oAd8zxWp5ycZFMfnxh)
- [Seedance 2.5 Launch Blog](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/blog/one-take-creation-flexible-referencing-introducing-seedance-2-5)
- [BytePlus ModelArk Model List](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1330310)
- [Seedance 2.0 Prompt Guide](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/2222480) (legacy — for 2.0, use `seedance-prompt-20`)

When the official guide is updated, prefer the live page over this skill where
they conflict.

## Core prompt formula

> **Subject + Action or Event + Scene and Environment (optional) + Visual Style (optional) + Camera Movement/Cut (optional) + Audio (optional)**

Only **Subject + Action** is required. Every other part is optional — omit what
does not apply. Summarize the main action first; add detail only to critical
movements. Write the Action slot as granular physical detail — see
[Action description](references/scene-action.md#action-description). **Do not describe the same action
twice.** Generation parameters (duration, resolution, aspect ratio) belong in
the generation interface or API, not in the prompt.

```
<Subject> performs <primary action or event> in <scene and environment>.
The visuals feature <visual style>.
Use <shot size, camera angle, camera movement, or cuts>.
Audio includes <dialogue, ambience, sound effects, or music>.
```

### Visual Style slot composition

When combining multiple Visual Style presets (lighting, lens character, color
grade, sensor/film look), chain them in this order within a single "The visuals
feature ..." sentence:

> **lighting → lens character → color grade → sensor/film look**

Example with three presets active:

```
The visuals feature warm golden key light from screen-right, shallow depth of
field with compressed bokeh, a teal-and-orange cinematic grade, and subtle
film grain with soft halation.
```

Each preset skill (`seedance-lighting-presets`, `seedance-lens-presets`,
`color-grade-palettes`) produces one phrase; this rule defines how they
assemble. Use only the presets the user requested — do not pad the slot with
unused defaults.

### Example

```
A ceramic artist finishes a pale blue cup in a studio at dawn, lifts it from the wheel,
and places it in the center of a wooden shelf.
Soft morning light enters through the window. The wet clay has a delicate sheen, and the
workbench remains tidy.
Begin with a medium shot of the wheel-throwing process, slowly push in toward the cup's
surface texture, then cut to a frontal view of the shelf.
Retain the low hum of the pottery wheel, the friction of clay, and subtle indoor ambience.
```

### Stylized animation medium

When the user requests claymation, felt, wood puppets, toy miniatures, vintage
cel/rubber-hose animation, painterly 2D, handcrafted 3D, silicone creatures,
wax crayon, or another medium whose material behavior must persist through
motion, compose with the `seedance-animation-styles` skill, which owns the
medium, construction, deformation, craft-imperfection, and still-anchor
contract; this skill remains the authority for the full six-part prompt,
reference roles, scene staging, timestamps, audio syntax, and generation
limitations.

### Music-video treatment

When the prompt's timing, energy, and structure must follow a song — music
video, lyric video, visualizer, or performer-driven clip — compose with the
`seedance-music-video` skill, which owns the format selection, song-section
map, beat/cut-density contract, audio-first lip-sync contract, and per-genre
style lock; this skill remains the authority for the six-part formula, reference
roles, audio bracket syntax, timestamps, and generation limitations.

## Parameter auto-lock rules

Three task types automatically lock generation parameters based on input materials:

| Task Type | Aspect Ratio | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **Video editing** | Locked to input video's ratio; **cannot be set** | Locked to ~input duration (±0.3s); **cannot be set** |
| **First/last-frame generation** | Locked to **first image's ratio**. First & last must match | Can be set |
| **Video extension** | Locked to input video's ratio; **cannot be set** | Can be set |

## Revision contract

When revising an existing take, record the creative delta before rewriting:

```text
Locked decisions:
- [approved identity, action, camera, environment, audio, and boundary behavior]

Requested delta:
- [the one behavior that must change]

Acceptance criteria:
- [observable conditions that make the next take pass]

Known rejections:
- [behaviors from earlier takes that must not return]
```

Carry locked decisions into the revised prompt. Change one of prompt wording,
reference bundle, or motion design at a time when practical so the cause of
improvement or regression remains identifiable.

## Preflight review

Before generation, verify:

1. **Subject & action**: Does the prompt clearly state the subject and primary action?
2. **Reference roles**: Does every reference state what to use and what not to use?
3. **Subject binding**: Is every required canonical character, product, and prop named and bound to a reference, with incidental objects handled by the prop threshold?
4. **Scene selection**: Are references selected by scene, not forced to appear all at once?
5. **Stage structure**: Does each stage contain only one primary change and a clear end state?
6. **Consistency**: Do character count, clothing, prop ownership, and spatial relationships stay consistent?
7. **Editing master**: For editing, is the sole editing master, edit scope, target quantity, and content to preserve defined?
8. **Emotion & camera**: Are abstract emotions and cinematography terms paired with visible/audible cues?
9. **First/last frames**: Are first/last frames assigned one role per image? Do first and last share aspect ratio?
10. **Storyboards & blockouts**: Does the storyboard state which structure to inherit? For blockouts, is coarse vs fine identified? Is a video-lock master treated as the sole motion authority, re-dressed not re-imagined?
11. **Auto-lock rules**: Do editing, first/last-frame, and extension follow their locked aspect-ratio and duration rules?
12. **Extension boundary**: For extension, are the boundary image, motion trend, and audio continuity checked?
13. **One-click video**: Are material roles, image order, motion amount, editing style, and audio defined?
14. **Seamless transitions**: Are the two videos' roles, trigger action, transition process, and arrival state defined?
15. **Action granularity**: Is the primary action described at the body-part level with range, speed, force, and physics grounding — not as a bare verb?

## Usage limitations

- Timestamps allocate time to events; they are **not frame-accurate edit points**.
- Video-editing prompts improve the probability of alignment but cannot guarantee frame-by-frame overlap.
- Multi-reference goal is to select and combine correct materials, **not** to make every material appear at once.
- For subtitles, formulas, signs, product specs, or frame-level timing that must be completely accurate, use prepared reference materials, video generation, and post-production together.
- Video editing locks input aspect ratio and approximate duration (±0.3s); neither can be set separately.
- First/last-frame generation locks aspect ratio to the first image; duration can be set. Mismatched ratios may stretch the last frame.
- Video extension locks input aspect ratio; extension duration can be set.
- For one-click video, specify image order and character mapping explicitly if they matter.
- Seamless transitions aim for visual/audio continuity; they do not guarantee pixel-identical preservation.


## Intentional conditioning representation

A sketch or blockout stays `control_only: true` while it is analysis-only. To
use intentional conditioning, first obtain explicit selection of a derived
composition or motion reference. Record its exact selected manifest, current
SHA-256, `reference_image` or `reference_video` role, and `control_only: false`.
Confirm live model/mode support. Flipping the flag alone never grants approval;
the caller applies the [production policy](../../contracts/production-policy.md).
