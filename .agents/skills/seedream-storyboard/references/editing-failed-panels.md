## Edit pattern for a failed panel

For a failed panel in separate-images mode, use a narrow revision contract on
that panel's image. For a failed panel in single-image grid mode, either
re-generate the whole grid with an adjusted prompt, or use `seedream_edit_image`
with a bounding box targeting just the failed panel's cell.

### HTTPS URL requirement for edits

`seedream_edit_image` requires HTTPS URLs — local file paths are not accepted.
Before editing:

1. Upload the grid image via `media_upload` (if not already cached), or
2. Call `media_presign` on an existing `object_key` from `ref_cache.json` to
   get a fresh presigned URL.

Presigned URLs expire in ~10 minutes — submit the edit task immediately after
obtaining the URL.

### Grid-to-bbox coordinate mapping

`seedream_edit_image` uses normalized coordinates (0–999) for both x and y.
For a grid with R rows and C columns, each cell occupies a range of width
`999/C` and height `999/R`. Use this table or the formula to target a specific
panel.

**Formula:**

```text
cell_width  = 999 / C
cell_height = 999 / R
panel_col   = (panel_index - 1) % C      (0-indexed)
panel_row   = (panel_index - 1) // C     (0-indexed)
x1 = round(panel_col * cell_width)
y1 = round(panel_row * cell_height)
x2 = round((panel_col + 1) * cell_width)
y2 = round((panel_row + 1) * cell_height)
```

**Quick reference — 3×3 grid (most common):**

| Panel | Position | x1 | y1 | x2 | y2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | top-left | 0 | 0 | 333 | 333 |
| 2 | top-center | 333 | 0 | 666 | 333 |
| 3 | top-right | 666 | 0 | 999 | 333 |
| 4 | mid-left | 0 | 333 | 333 | 666 |
| 5 | mid-center | 333 | 333 | 666 | 666 |
| 6 | mid-right | 666 | 333 | 999 | 666 |
| 7 | bottom-left | 0 | 666 | 333 | 999 |
| 8 | bottom-center | 333 | 666 | 666 | 999 |
| 9 | bottom-right | 666 | 666 | 999 | 999 |

**Quick reference — 2×3 grid:**

| Panel | Position | x1 | y1 | x2 | y2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | top-left | 0 | 0 | 499 | 333 |
| 2 | top-right | 499 | 0 | 999 | 333 |
| 3 | mid-left | 0 | 333 | 499 | 666 |
| 4 | mid-right | 499 | 333 | 999 | 666 |
| 5 | bottom-left | 0 | 666 | 499 | 999 |
| 6 | bottom-right | 499 | 666 | 999 | 999 |

Add a small margin (e.g. ±5) to avoid the divider line bleeding into the edit.

### Revision contract

```text
References:
@Image 1: base storyboard panel to edit
@Image 2: approved character identity

Task:
Image Editing — local storyboard correction

Edit instructions:
In @Image 1, [single requested change at the marked point or bounding box].
Use the identity from @Image 2 for [character]. Preserve the camera, composition,
pose, screen direction, background geometry, lighting, palette, and all
unmarked subjects and props.

Acceptance criteria:
- [observable result]
- [continuity property that must remain unchanged]

Constraints:
No new subjects, no wardrobe change, no background redesign, no text, no
watermark, and no changes outside the target region.
```

Change one failed dimension at a time. Use the corrected result as a continuity
anchor only after it passes review.
