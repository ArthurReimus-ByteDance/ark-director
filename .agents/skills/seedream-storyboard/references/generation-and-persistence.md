### 10. Generate variants when requested or authorized

For actual image creation:

- use `seedream_generate_image` for a single panel, a single-image grid, or a
  sequence-capable batch of separate images;
- use `seedream_generate_image_variations` for independent alternatives;
- use `seedream_edit_image` for point- or bounding-box-guided corrections;
- set `persist: true`;
- use the lowest suitable draft size;
- set `watermark: false` unless the user requires a visible watermark;
- use `prompt_optimization: standard` for final candidates and `fast` only when
  latency matters more than fidelity.
- Upload and pass the resolved local Element files as ordered reference inputs;
  keep their `@Image N` indices identical in the prompt, request, and manifest.

For a one-panel board, generate three alternatives of that same panel by
default: `p010 v01`, `p010 v02`, and `p010 v03`. They share the same decisive
moment and continuity contract but explore useful composition, lens, staging,
or lighting differences. They are candidates, not a narrative sequence.

For a multi-panel single-image grid board, generate three variants of the whole
grid by default: `board v01`, `board v02`, and `board v03`. They share the same
panel plan and continuity contract but may differ in composition within each
cell, grid layout balance, or rendering.

For a multi-panel separate-images board, generate three variants by default for
keyframes and high-risk panels. For ordinary continuity panels, first generate
one low-cost draft sequence; add alternatives only where composition or
continuity is unresolved.

If the user explicitly says they are working in Lumina, return clean
copy-pasteable prompts and parameters only. Do not call generation tools or
write local assets.

### 11. Persist every generated result locally

Never rely only on a provider URL. Use durable artifact persistence and save the
actual file under:

```text
projects/<project>/scenes/scene-NN/
```

For individual panels (one-panel board, separate-images mode, or a panel
promoted from a grid):

```text
<scene>_sh<NNN>_p<NNN>_t<NN>_v<NN>.<ext>
```

Example:

```text
s01_sh010_p020_t01_v01.png
prompt_s01_sh010_p020_t01_v01.md
```

For a single-image grid (the whole board in one file):

```text
<scene>_sh<NNN>_board_t<NN>_v<NN>.<ext>
```

Example:

```text
s01_sh010_board_t01_v01.png
prompt_s01_sh010_board_t01_v01.md
```

The `board` token indicates the composite grid image containing all panels;
individual panel prompts are recorded in the same prompt snapshot under their
panel numbers.

### Downloading artifacts

`seed_media_get_artifact` returns Base64-encoded media bytes that can be large
(1MB+ for grid images). The tool output may be truncated for large artifacts.
To reliably save the file locally, extract the Base64 data from the tool
response and decode it:

```python
import json, base64

with open('<tool_output_file>', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

result = data.get('result', data)
if isinstance(result, str):
    result = json.loads(result)

b64 = result.get('data')
if not b64 and 'result' in result and isinstance(result['result'], dict):
    b64 = result['result'].get('data')
if not b64 and 'content' in result:
    for item in result['content']:
        if isinstance(item, dict) and item.get('type') == 'text':
            text = item.get('text', '')
            if text.startswith('{'):
                b64 = json.loads(text).get('data')
                break

img_bytes = base64.b64decode(b64)
with open('<output_path>', 'wb') as out:
    out.write(img_bytes)
```

Alternatively, if `persist: true` was set on the generation call, use the
artifact URI (`seed-media://artifacts/<id>`) to retrieve the bytes via
`seed_media_get_artifact` in a follow-up call, or pass `response_format: "url"`
to get a direct presigned URL for `curl`/`wget` download.

### Manifest and metadata

The prompt snapshot must contain the exact submitted prompt and parameters, with
its SHA-256 in the manifest. When an approved panel is explicitly promoted to a
video keyframe, use the project keyframe naming convention separately:

```text
s01_kf01_v01.png
```

Do not overwrite the storyboard source panel.

Record:

- model and model ID;
- ordered reference list and role of each image;
- prompt file and hash;
- size, format, watermark, seed, optimization mode, and batch count;
- output path, byte size, and hash;
- provider artifact ID when available;
- generated variants;
- requested delta and acceptance criteria;
- status;
- `source_assets` with each path, role, selected variant, approval state, and
  SHA-256;
- `video_handoff` with eligibility, promoted keyframe path, recommended image
  mode, target Seedance version (2.5 or 2.0), reference budget, and any
  invalidation reason.

Set a newly generated output to `review`, not `approved`.
Set `video_handoff.eligible: true` only after explicit panel approval and after
verifying that all recorded source-asset variants and hashes still match. A
changed character, location, or prop returns the dependent panel to `review`;
do not silently carry a stale panel into motion generation.

Use this minimum `source_assets` record for every visible canonical Element:

```yaml
source_assets:
  - element_id: lola-maria
    element_type: character
    role: character_identity
    path: elements/lola-maria/ref_01_front.png
    selected_variant: ref_01_front.png
    status: approved
    sha256: "..."
    prompt_token: "@Image 1"
```
