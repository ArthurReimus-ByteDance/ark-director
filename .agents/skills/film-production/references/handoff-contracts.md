# Cross-Modality Handoff Contracts

Before each handoff, update the source and destination stage entries in the
project canvas, regenerate `index.html`, and run the source stage freshness
check. The receiving stage reads its inputs from that synchronized canvas and
owning manifests rather than reconstructing state from chat.

## Canon to storyboard

Pass selected element paths, roles, approval states, hashes, and stable prompt
tokens. If an element is not approved, keep the dependent board in `draft` or
`review` and make video handoff ineligible.

## Storyboard to video

Treat elements as identity sources and storyboard panels as derivative
composition anchors. Require explicit panel selection, verify source hashes,
and choose exactly one supported image mode: I2V, FLF2V, R2V, or T2V. Never
promote a multi-panel contact sheet as a clean video keyframe.

## Audio to video (when user requests lip-synced dialogue)

Use the exact same dialogue text in both prompts. Verify audio duration does not
exceed video duration, map dialogue to observed audio timing, pass the file as
`reference_audio`, and record its path and hash in the shot manifest. Skip this
handoff when the user has not requested lip-synced audio.

## Shot to assembly

Accept only user-approved takes. Pass local paths, hashes, actual duration,
resolution, frame rate, audio properties, intended order, transition notes, and
known defects. Do not treat `succeeded` as creative approval.

## Dependency invalidation

When a selected element, audio file, storyboard anchor, or exact prompt changes,
identify every dependent artifact. Return affected downstream artifacts to
`review`; preserve their files, prompts, task IDs, hashes, and rejection history.
Update the canvas statuses and regenerate it in the same change so the visible
dependency state cannot lag behind the manifests.
