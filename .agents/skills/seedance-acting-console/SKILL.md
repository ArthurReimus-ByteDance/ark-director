  Turn a directing directive into a production-grade Seedance acting block.
  Two layers: (1) Scene-level acting analysis — read the whole scene, find the
  shared direction, each character's motive, goal, obstacle, and tactic with
  eye-work as purposeful action. (2) Cue encoding — map the tactic's visible
  footprint to directly observable physical cues at three intensity levels using
  a six-emotion bank. Use this skill when directing the performance, acting,
  emotional intensity, mood of the scene, facial expression, delivering a line,
  or when a character reads dead, glassy, flat, or over-acted. Composes with
  seedance-prompt-25 and optionally with seed-audio-prompt for dialogue
  reinforcement. Never calls generation tools itself.

# Seedance Acting Console

Turn a single creative directive into a complete, generation-ready performance
spec. The console has two layers that work in sequence:

1. **Analysis layer** — Read the whole scene, find the shared direction, then
   derive each character's motive, goal, obstacle, and tactic. The emotion is
   a byproduct of the tactic — never the starting point.
2. **Encoding layer** — Map the tactic's visible footprint to directly
   observable physical cues at three intensity levels. The six-emotion bank is
   a lookup table for encoding, not a menu to pick from.

This skill is **prompt-composition only**. It never calls MCP/Ark generation
tools directly; it composes with `seedance-prompt-25` (prompt grammar) and
optionally with `seed-audio-prompt` (Seed Audio voice profiles).

## Analysis layer

### Core principle

An acting task is when the character is **INVESTED in their tactic of reaching
the goal.**

- It is NOT a description of external behavior ("eyes flick," "brows lift," "he
  looks sad") — that is playing the result, and it produces dead faces.
- It is NOT necessarily physical action. The tactic can live entirely **in the
  eyes**: a different look when someone humiliates vs. begs; a person arguing
  from conviction constantly checks BOTH eyes of the partner, hunting for a
  sparkle of trust, registering whether the partner is interested or drifting —
  and adjusts to what they find.
- The eye movement IS the doing. Aliveness = the mind visibly working on the
  task, moment to moment.
- Never fix dead eyes with lighting tricks (catchlights etc.). Fix them by
  giving the eyes a task.

### The ladder (work strictly in this order)

#### 0. Read the WHOLE scene dialogue first

Never build a task from one line. The task lives across the entire exchange —
where it holds, where it breaks. Check every line of every character before
directing any of them.

#### 1. Goal of the SCENE — one shared direction

The scene has ONE goal: a single direction ALL characters play toward, usually
unspoken — a mutual silent agreement about how this time will be lived.

Example (mother packs son's suitcase, army in an hour): the goal of the scene
is **make it painless — hide the feeling, don't leave each other with pain or
sorrow, never lose the positiveness.** It belongs to both at once.

The scene goal is NOT the film's dramaturgic function (the reveal, the theme).
Characters never know or play the film's purposes — those are accomplished
THROUGH them, as a byproduct.

#### 1a. The ENDING names the event

Always look at how the scene ENDS before naming its event. The last line/beat
is the key you read the whole scene backward through. Watch for the
double-meaning last line — spoken about one thing, meant about another ("Poor
bastard. Just can't forgive himself" — said looking at the patient, meant about
himself).

#### 1b. ALL in one event

The event must contain EVERY character in the scene — including silent or
unconscious ones — as participants or mirrors of the same process. If a
character stands outside the named event, the event is named wrong.

#### 1c. The PHYSICAL ACTION is the channel

The surface activity of the scene (the "terrain" — e.g., routine rounds;
packing a suitcase) stays as the PHYSICAL ACTION, and each character pursues
the event THROUGH it — each via their own distinct, visible physical behavior.
The invisible task must have a physical channel the camera can read.

Rule: give every character in the scene their own physical channel for the same
event — different behaviors, one event, one terrain.

#### 2. Each character's MOTIVE — different fuel, same direction

Every character pushes along the same scene direction, but each **for their own
reason**. The son keeps it painless *for mom*; the mother *out of superstition*
(no tears before a journey — bad omen). Same vector, different fuel — the fuel
is what makes each performance distinct while the scene reads unified.

Motives can be alternative hypotheses; the director picks. Given circumstances
constrain motives: a man who took the job at an experimental convict lab is
ALREADY compromised — he cannot play a moral innocent.

#### 3. Each character's GOAL — the personal fight

Born from the motive: what this person is fighting for themselves inside the
scene. Ordinary, personal, playable. Never the same words as the scene goal,
never the theme.

#### 4. OBSTACLE — what presses against the direction

The thing threatening to break the scene's line (the real feeling pressing to
surface; the case too horrifying to stay routine). One crack and the shared goal
collapses. This pressure is what the audience actually feels — precisely because
nobody plays it; everyone plays keeping it out.

#### 5. TACTIC — the acting task proper

The invested, moment-to-moment pursuit, written as what the character is DOING
to the partner — with the eye-work named as purposeful action:

- checking both of the partner's eyes for a sparkle of trust
- registering after each point: did it land? interested or about to smirk?
- stealing looks and snapping back before being caught
- measuring the partner, memorizing them, comparing what I feel with what they
  show

Beats are keyed to the actual dialogue words. Where the script demands it, mark
the point where a character's fuel runs out and the line breaks (the medic's
"...Poor bastard," under his breath — the break IS the delivery of the scene).

### Contrast pairing (build duos on mirrored +/-)

A two-character scene is richer when the pair is built on CONTRAST — each
character carries a plus and a minus, mirrored against the other, with one axis
being the essential one the audience reads.

Rules:
- Each character gets one + and one −, inverted relative to the partner.
- Name the ESSENTIAL AXIS of the scene — that opposition is what the audience
  actually reads; the other traits are the color.
- Both still push the same scene direction — the contrast lives UNDER the shared
  direction and leaks out through the tactics and the eyes.
- The seeming trait is often scar tissue over its opposite: "careless" = hope
  lost, not care absent. Direct the history, not the surface.

### Common analysis failures to catch

- Task built from one line instead of the whole dialogue → re-read the scene
  first.
- The film's reveal/theme assigned to a character as their task → characters
  never play the film's purposes.
- Scene goal confused with character goal → scene goal is the shared direction;
  character goals are personal and differ.
- Motive ignores given circumstances (playing innocence while already
  complicit) → re-derive motive.
- Prescribed eye/face choreography instead of eye-work as purposeful action →
  rewrite as verbs at the partner.
- Emotion adjectives as direction → replace with the task that produces the
  emotion.

---

## Encoding layer

The analysis layer determines *what the character is doing*. The encoding layer
translates that into *what the model needs to render*. The cues are derived from
the **tactic**, not the emotion label — instead of "character is angry →
clenched fists" (playing the result), it becomes "character is checking the
partner's eyes for trust after being humiliated — jaw tightens, eyes sharpen,
breathing controlled" (the cues come from what the character is doing, not what
they're feeling).

### Emotion bank

Six emotions, each externalized as **directly visible or audible cues** at three
intensity levels. Intensity is never encoded with degree adjectives ("very
sad", "extremely angry") — it is encoded purely through graduated cues: number
of cue channels engaged, amplitude, movement degree, and vocal delivery.

| Emotion | Abstract one-liner | Intensity 1 (low) | Intensity 2 (medium) | Intensity 3 (high) | Seed Audio delivery hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Serenity** | A settled, unhurried inner calm with no internal conflict. | Gaze soft and level; breathing slow and even; corners of the mouth at rest. | Eyes half-lidded, brows relaxed; slow, deep breaths; hands loosely folded or open palms. | Shoulders fully dropped; a slow exhale with eyes briefly closed; a subtle, contented smile. | Calm, measured; slow, soft, unhurried. |
| **Joy** | Bright, open, expansive happiness that lifts the body and face. | The corner of the mouth lifts faintly; the eyes soften. | An uncontrollable smile; brows relax; steps become light. | Laughing, spinning in place, breathless; eyes crinkled. | Bright, warm; light and quickening, occasionally breaking into laughter. |
| **Terror** | Overwhelming dread that triggers the freeze response. Built from gaze fixed, brows lowered, tense stillness plus panic respiratory signs. | Gaze fixed; pupils widen; a visible swallow; breathing turns shallow. | Eyes widen fully; brows raised and rigid; chest heaves; hands freeze mid-motion. | Frozen stillness; mouth slightly open; body tensed; a choked, sharp intake of breath. | Thin, breathy; shaky, rapid, strained. |
| **Rage** | Hot, escalating anger pressing outward at a target. | Jawline tense; eyes sharp; nostrils flare slightly. | Both fists clenched; chest heaving; eyes sharp; jaw working. | Veins at the temple; trembling fists; shouts with the voice cracking; whole body coiled. | Shouted, voice cracking; harsh, escalating, clipped. |
| **Fear** | Anxious apprehension and watchfulness about a perceived danger. | Eyes darting; fingers tapping; weight shifting; frequent glancing. | Rapid breathing; eyes darting; biting the lip; hands fidgeting. | Body pulled back; shoulders hunched; gaze searching; voice cracking; quick shallow breaths. | Shaky, rapid; hesitant, tremulous, quickened. |
| **Vigilance** | Sharpened, controlled alertness scanning for threat or opportunity. Built from gaze fixed, brows lowered, tense stillness. | Gaze steady; brows level; posture still but ready. | Gaze fixed and scanning; brows lowered; body still; breathing held. | Utterly still; eyes narrow and unblinking; head slowly panning; hands ready at the sides. | Low, steady; measured, controlled, clipped. |

### Using the bank with the analysis

The bank is a **lookup table**, not a menu. After completing the analysis
ladder, identify which emotion family the tactic's visible footprint belongs
to, then select cues from the appropriate intensity level. Adapt the cues to
serve the tactic — the tactic determines which cues are relevant, not the other
way around.

Example: The analysis produces a tactic of "checking the partner's eyes for a
sparkle of trust after being humiliated." This lives in the **Fear** family at
intensity 2, but the cues are adapted: eyes darting becomes eyes deliberately
searching; biting the lip becomes jaw controlled to prevent a tremor. The
emotion label is a reference point; the tactic owns the cues.

### Intensity encoding guide

Intensity level is a **design-level encoding choice**, not a number the model
reads. Levels 1/2/3 differ on the same emotion through three graduated levers:

1. **Number of cue channels engaged** — one or two channels at level 1 (face
   only), more channels at level 3 (face + hands + breathing + body + voice).
2. **Amplitude** — faint and contained (a flicker) vs pronounced (a shaking
   fist, tears streaming).
3. **Movement degree** — static containment (held breath, frozen stillness) vs
   full-body release (spinning, shouting, recoiling).
4. **Vocal delivery** — calm and measured, strained and quickened, or shouted /
   cracking.

Never write "very happy" or "extremely terrified" — replace the adjective with
more cues and more amplitude.

## Output grammar

### The ACTING TASK block

Format inside a Seedance prompt:

```
ACTING TASK — [NAME] (invested in their tactic; the work happens in the eyes):
SCENE DIRECTION (shared, unspoken): [one line]
MOTIVE (their fuel): [why THEY push that direction]
GOAL: [their personal fight]
OBSTACLE: [what presses against the line, what one crack costs]
TACTIC: [what they do to the partner, with the eye-work as action]
CUES: [observable physical cues derived from the tactic — gaze, brows, mouth,
breathing, hands, body — at the appropriate intensity level]
Moment to moment:
— "[dialogue words]" — [verb at the partner + what the eyes check]
— "[dialogue words]" — [verb + eye-work]
— [where the line breaks, if it breaks]
(Safety: gaze always engaged in the task — never a frozen, glassy, unfocused
stare; natural blink cadence, actors blink now and then to moisturize their eyes.)
```

Rules:
- Verbs directed at the partner; no adjectives of emotion as instruction
  ("sadly," "nervously").
- No facial choreography ("brows lift," "mouth trembles") — externals only as
  the safety line above.
- Nobody plays the emotion; everyone plays the direction. The audience
  receives the feeling through the pressure.
- One safety line against the frozen stare is allowed and recommended (AI-model
  necessity).
- Every character in frame gets living eyes this way — including silent
  listeners: a listener's task is also real (e.g., "decide if they're serious,"
  "wait for the punchline," "protect the mood").

### Single emotional transition (one emotion, one change)

Use for a single emotional shift over the shot. Keep **2-4 observable cues**
for the transition — cue overload destabilizes the performance.

```
The overall emotion shifts from <starting emotion> to <ending emotion>.
After <triggering event>, <character> first shows <immediate observable reaction>.
Then, <eyes, brows, mouth, breathing, gaze, or hand movement> gradually <changes>.
Finally, <character> expresses <target emotion> through <restrained or explicit outward behavior>.
```

### Multi-stage emotion (arc over time)

Use when the emotion changes several times, with trigger events and timestamps.

```
When <character> hears or sees <first triggering event>, <first observable reaction>.
When <second triggering event> occurs, <change in expression, gaze, or breathing>.
After confirming <critical information>, the emotion that <character> tries to restrain
or conceal gradually becomes visible through <observable behavior>.
Finally, <character's final action, expression, or manner of speaking>.
```

### Dialogue, delivery, and language

When dialogue is set, place the exact line inside `{curly braces}` and give the
delivery style plus the dialogue language (non-Chinese dialogue needs the
language stated):

```
Dialogue language: <language>. <character> <says/shouts/whispers> in <delivery style>: {<exact line>}
```

### Worked example

Directive: A woman confronts a locked door. Her husband just left. Scene
direction: keep it together, don't break down. Tactic: checking the door for
signs he'll come back, eyes hunting for a reason. Emotion family: Fear at
intensity 2. Dialogue: "Get out of my way."

```
ACTING TASK — GLORIA (invested in checking whether he's really gone; the work
happens in her eyes):
SCENE DIRECTION (shared, unspoken): keep it together — don't let this be real yet.
MOTIVE (her fuel): superstition — if she doesn't break, he might still come back.
GOAL: find proof it's not over.
OBSTACLE: the locked door; the silence on the other side; the feeling pressing
to surface.
TACTIC: pressing the door, testing the handle, eyes hunting the frame for
anything he left behind — checking the threshold, the mat, the hallway.
CUES: eyes darting and searching (Fear I2); rapid breathing; biting the lip;
hands fidgeting with the handle; weight shifting toward the door.
Moment to moment:
— presses the handle — finds it locked — eyes snap to the gap under the door
— "Get out of my way." — said at the door, voice strained, eyes still searching
the frame
— the line breaks at "way" — she heard her own voice and it scared her
(Safety: gaze always engaged in the task; natural blink cadence.)
```

Dialogue language: American English. Gloria says in a sharp, strained voice
through gritted teeth: {Get out of my way.}

For the full scene prompt, drop this acting block into the six-part formula
(Subject + Action + Scene + Visual Style + Camera + Audio) as the subject/action
section, per `seedance-prompt-25`.

---

## Audio reinforcement (optional)

When the scene has spoken dialogue and the user wants lip-sync, generate the
Seed Audio dialogue track first and pass it as `reference_audio` to Seedance.
This is the stronger acting lever: lip-sync constrains the on-screen performance
to the voice emotion.

**Optionally compose with `seed-audio-prompt`** for Seed Audio voice profile
composition and generation. The exact dialogue lines in the Seed Audio `text_prompt` must appear
verbatim inside `{curly braces}` in the Seedance prompt. If one changes, both
change.

Keep `audio_duration <= video_duration`. If the audio exceeds the video
duration, trim the audio prompt (shorter ambience tails, fewer pauses, tighter
scene descriptions) and regenerate. Never pad the video to fit an over-long
audio.

After generating the audio, inspect it (or transcribe with `speech_to_text`)
and set the shot timestamps so each line lands at the second it actually occurs.

Record the audio asset path, SHA-256, verified duration, and the
dialogue-to-shot timestamp mapping in `shot.md` and `scene.md`.

---

## Edge cases and guardrails

- **Intensity is not numerically controllable.** The model reads cues, not
  numbers. Validate each intensity level with a same-seed A/B before trusting
  it, and record the chosen level in `shot.md`.
- **2-4 cues per single transition.** More cues overload the performance and
  destabilize it. If more beats are needed, switch to the multi-stage template.
- **No degree adjectives.** "Very sad", "extremely angry", "super happy" are
  banned. Encode intensity via graduated cues (channel count, amplitude,
  movement degree, vocal delivery).
- **Cues serve the tactic, not the emotion label.** Always derive visible
  behavior from what the character is doing (the tactic), not from what they're
  feeling. The emotion bank is a lookup table, not a menu.
- **Dialogue must be verbatim across both prompts.** If the Seed Audio line or
  the Seedance `{line}` changes, change both. A mismatch causes lip-sync drift.
- **Audio longer than video: trim audio, never pad video.** Reduce pauses,
  ambience tails, and scene description in the Seed Audio prompt; regenerate.
- **Emotion arcs need the multi-stage template + timestamps.** A single
  transition template cannot carry several emotion changes.
- **`reference_audio` forces lip-sync, not acting fidelity.** It locks the voice
  and mouth timing to the audio emotion. Whether Seedance visibly acts the
  emotion needs an empirical A/B: same prompt, neutral voice vs angry voice.
- **`watermark: false` by default** for all image, video, and audio generation.
  Enable the AIGC watermark only when explicitly requested.
- **Cost.** Audio and video bill per generation. Prototype at the lowest
  suitable resolution and duration; confirm duration fits before submitting the
  video task.
- **Content safety.** Do not direct performances depicting identifiable real
  people without rights or otherwise restricted content.

## Self-check checklist

Before finalizing an acting block or plan, verify:

- [ ] The whole scene dialogue was read before building any character's task.
- [ ] The scene direction is shared, unspoken, and belongs to all characters.
- [ ] Each character has a distinct motive, goal, obstacle, and tactic.
- [ ] The tactic names eye-work as purposeful action — not facial choreography.
- [ ] No emotion adjectives as direction ("sadly," "nervously," "angrily").
- [ ] The cues are derived from the tactic, not from the emotion label.
- [ ] Every cue is directly observable or audible — no bare abstract emotion
      words standing alone.
- [ ] Intensity is encoded via graduated cues (channel count, amplitude,
      movement degree, vocal delivery), with zero degree adjectives.
- [ ] A single emotional transition uses 2-4 cues max; more beats use the
      multi-stage template.
- [ ] Every arc beat carries a trigger event and a timestamp.
- [ ] When dialogue is set, the line appears verbatim inside `{}` with a delivery
      style and dialogue language.
- [ ] When audio reinforcement is used: Seed Audio voice profile composed,
      duration checked (`audio_duration <= video_duration`), `reference_audio`
      passed as `@Audio 1`, identical `{dialogue}` text in both prompts, shot
      timestamps aligned to actual audio.
- [ ] `shot.md` records the audio asset path, SHA-256, verified duration, and
      the dialogue-to-shot mapping; `scene.md` carries the same single source
      of truth.
- [ ] `watermark: false` unless the user explicitly requested the AIGC
      watermark.
