# Seed Audio Prompt

Write production-grade prompts for BytePlus Seed Audio 1.0 (model ID `seed-audio-1.0`), a multimodal full-soundscape generator that produces dialogue, background music, sound effects, and ambience in a single pass. Unlike traditional TTS, Seed Audio 1.0 is an "audio director" that interprets scene descriptions, character voice profiles, and script content simultaneously.


## Input and output contract

Input: audio purpose, exact dialogue where present, sound layers, output configuration, and optional voice references.

Output: a complete T2A or TA2A soundscape prompt and explicit ordered bindings.

## Procedure and reference loading

Read references-and-modes plus soundscape-arrangement. Add dialogue-and-voices only for speaking/singing characters. Music, ambience, and SFX beds do not require dialogue or narrative obstacles. Timestamp control is optional when timing is not requested.

Read only the mode-specific resources needed for the request. Reference paths
mentioned in prose are relative to this skill directory unless a link says otherwise.

## Submission boundary and failure behavior

The caller owns production authorization, the exact request preflight, and the
complete hash-bound prompt review. A leaf returns its prompt package without
loading sibling skills. An explicitly declared orchestrator may coordinate the
review and submission stages. Missing required inputs remain unresolved; a draft
or technical success does not establish user approval. Preserve optional timing,
the three-image sampling default where applicable, and the requested delta.

## Evidence and creative advice

Distinguish four kinds of guidance when they affect a decision: **API requirement**
(verify with the selected live tool and its current source), **documented prompting
convention** (attribute to the linked guide), **observed result** (identify the
actual artifact, model and conditions), and **optional artistic technique**
(a hypothesis or choice to test). Model/price tables are reference snapshots,
not live capability evidence. Examples without linked result evidence are
hypothetical; do not describe them as proven improvements. Keep these labels in
reasoning or evaluation notes when useful, not boilerplate in every final prompt.

## Source authority

The public API reference is the authoritative source of truth for request fields and limits. Prompt-writing conventions originate from the internal Seed Audio 1.0 prompting guide and are labeled where they are not defined in the public API.
- [Seed Audio 1.0 API Reference](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplusvoice/seedaudio-01) — authoritative
- [Seed Audio 1.0 Prompting Guide](https://bytedance.larkoffice.com/wiki/WgU4wFVQ8iZgvjkHHdbcDmhCnug) — T2A/TA2A prompting conventions and examples, modified July 23, 2026
- [Seed Audio 1.0 Pricing](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplusvoice/audiopricing) — authoritative

Seed Audio 1.0 is in early access. Applications for early access are open via a whitelist form; confirm current access status before building.

When the official API reference is updated, prefer the live page over this skill where they conflict.

## Prompt assembly

Build the shortest prompt that clearly communicates the requested result. Use plain-language headings only when they improve readability, and omit sections that do not apply.

For full-soundscape generation, cover the five ingredients recommended by the prompting guide:

1. The environment: location, weather, context, and acoustic space
2. Background music and sound effects
3. Character actions or appearance when they affect the performance
4. Each character's voice: age, gender, accent, emotion, tone, speed, and timbre as relevant
5. The exact dialogue

Arrange those ingredients as one chronological audio scene, not as unrelated inventories. A typical prompt follows this order:

1. Input references, only when the request includes reference audio
2. Opening environment, ambience, and music
3. Dialogue, actions, and sound effects in the order they occur
4. Ending behavior: resolve, fade, sustain, or cut
5. Creative or quality constraints, only when the user supplies them

Generation mode and request limits belong in request metadata or validation, not in model-facing prompt boilerplate.

## Ideal use cases

- **Audiobooks**: Prototype narration, dialogue and sound design. Human performance, editing and cost comparisons depend on the project; no universal replacement or savings claim is implied.
- **Video dubbing**: Generate character voices from text descriptions or reference audio. Human voice + SFX + background music in a single pass.
- **Gaming**: Generate character voices and environmental sound effects for immersive player experiences.
- **Podcast and radio drama**: Multi-character dialogue with full sound design from a single prompt.
- **Language learning content**: Generate audio in multiple languages, with per-sentence timestamp guidance for precise timing control.
