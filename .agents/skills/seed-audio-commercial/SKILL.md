# Seed Audio Commercial

Produce dramatic, story-driven audio commercials using BytePlus Seed Audio 1.0
(`seed-audio-1.0`). This skill composes full-soundscape T2A (text-to-audio)
prompts that produce dialogue, background music, sound effects, and ambience in
a single generation pass — no separate mixing, scoring, or Foley required.

**Pairs with `seed-audio-prompt`** for Seed Audio prompt structure, voice
profile formatting, timestamp control, API limits, and pricing. This skill
specializes the commercial workflow: story arc design, commercial-specific SFX
and music patterns, multilingual safety filter guidance, cost management, and
the production lifecycle.


## Input and output contract

Input: brand, audience, language, cast, story objective, duration and authorized generation scope.

Output: a commercial soundscape prompt, prepared request, durable audio, and QA evidence.

## Procedure and reference loading

The lifecycle below remains the entry path. Add commercial-sound-patterns to design music/SFX and worked-examples for a relevant commercial pattern; examples do not change the requested language or approve a retry.

Read only the mode-specific resources needed for the request. Reference paths
mentioned in prose are relative to this skill directory unless a link says otherwise.

- [Commercial Sound Patterns](references/commercial-sound-patterns.md) — Commercial music direction patterns; SFX patterns for food commercials; Ambience transition patterns; Story arc template (5 acts).
- [Worked Examples](references/worked-examples.md) — Full example: Jollibee Chickenjoy (Taglish); Full example: Lola Maria's Ube Halaya (Taglish, 30s spot).

## Submission boundary and failure behavior

The caller owns production authorization, the exact request preflight, and the
complete hash-bound prompt review. A leaf returns its prompt package without
loading sibling skills. An explicitly declared orchestrator may coordinate the
review and submission stages. Missing required inputs remain unresolved; a draft
or technical success does not establish user approval. Preserve optional timing,
the three-image sampling default where applicable, and the requested delta.

## What this skill produces

A finished audio commercial asset, saved locally, with:

- Full soundscape in one pass (dialogue + BGM + SFX + ambience)
- Multi-character voice profiles with distinct ages, accents, and emotions
- Dramatic story arc (setup → conflict → resolution → brand tagline)
- Music that shifts with the emotional beats of the story
- Chronologically interleaved SFX and ambience transitions
- Prompt snapshot, manifest, and verification metadata

## When to use this skill

- "Create an audio commercial for [brand/product]"
- "Make a dramatic radio spot for [product]"
- "Generate a story-based audio ad with dialogue and music"
- "Produce a Filipino/Taglish commercial using Seed Audio"
- "Write and generate a multi-character narrative audio spot"
- "Make a brand commercial with emotional arc and tagline"

## When NOT to use

- **Plain TTS or single-voice narration** — use `seed-audio-prompt` directly
  without the commercial story structure.
- **Video generation** — use Seedance skills (`seedance-prompt-25` for 2.5,
  `seedance-prompt-20` for 2.0). If the dialogue track is for a Seedance video
  and the user has explicitly requested lip-synced audio, generate the audio
  first, verify `duration ≤ video_duration`, and pass it as `reference_audio`.
  When the user has not requested lip-synced audio, generate video directly
  and let Seedance's native audio handle dialogue.
- **Image generation** — use Seedream skills (`seedream-prompt`).
- **Voice cloning for consistent characters across multiple clips** — use
  `seed-audio-prompt` in TA2A mode with reference audio clips.

```

### Step 1 — Gather the brief

Collect or propose:

| Field | Example | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Brand | Jollibee | Yes |
| Product | Chickenjoy (crispy fried chicken) | Yes |
| Tone | dramatic, emotional, nostalgic | Yes |
| Language | English, Taglish, Spanish, etc. | Yes |
| Target duration | ~60–120s (max 120s per call) | Yes |
| Cast | 2–4 characters with voice profiles | Yes |
| Story hook | homesick worker, family reunion, etc. | Yes |
| Tagline / CTA | "Home is just one bite away" | Yes |
| Cultural context | Filipino OFW experience, etc. | If relevant |

### Step 2 — Design the story arc

A dramatic commercial needs a **five-act micro-story**:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Act 1: Setup] --> B[Act 2: Conflict]
  B --> C[Act 3: Journey]
  C --> D[Act 4: Turn / Reveal]
  D --> E[Act 5: Resolution + Tagline]
```

| Act | Purpose | Audio character |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Setup** | Establish the emotional state and environment | Melancholic / tense music, sparse ambience |
| **2 — Conflict** | Introduce the tension or longing | Music intensifies or shifts, dialogue escalates |
| **3 — Journey** | Character moves toward the product | Ambience transitions, footsteps, door sounds |
| **4 — Turn / Reveal** | The product triggers an emotional shift | Music transforms (sad → warm), SFX (crunch, pour, sizzle) |
| **5 — Resolution + Tagline** | Emotional resolution, brand voiceover | Bright/uplifting music, announcer delivers CTA |

**Rules:**
- Each act must have a **distinct audio state** (music mood, ambience, intensity).
- Transitions between acts must be tied to **observable events** (a door opening,
  a bite, a phone ring), not arbitrary cuts.
- The product must be the **trigger for the emotional turn** in Act 4.
- The tagline in Act 5 must connect the emotional story to the brand promise.

### Step 3 — Compose the T2A prompt

Assemble the prompt using the full-soundscape order shown in the template below
(scene and atmosphere, characters and dialogue, ending), arranged as one
chronological audio scene. Use this commercial template:

```text
Scene and atmosphere
Environment: [location, time, weather, acoustic space, emotional tone]
Background music: [dramatic role, genre, instruments, tempo, mood, dynamic arc
  tied to story beats, mix relationship to dialogue, ending behavior]
Ambience: [foreground, midground, background layers and how they evolve]

Characters and dialogue
[SFX or ambience that opens the scene]

[Character A] ([age, gender, accent, voice timbre, emotional baseline, delivery
  style]) says [delivery note]: "[dialogue]"

[Music/SFX/ambience change triggered by the line or action.]

[Character B] ([contrasting voice profile]) replies [delivery]: "[dialogue]"

[Continue interleaving dialogue, actions, SFX, and score changes in
chronological order through all five acts.]

[Character A] (internal voice-over, [delivery]) says, voice [emotion]:
  "[emotional peak dialogue]"

[The brand tagline from the announcer.]

Announcer ([deep/warm/confident, gender, broadcaster tone]) says with [tone]:
  "[Brand]. [Product qualities]. [Tagline / CTA]."

[The brand jingle plays its final bright notes and resolves cleanly.]

Ending
[Describe the final sound: music resolution, ambience tail, fade to silence.]
```

### Step 4 — Validate before generating

Check these constraints before calling `seed_audio_generate`:

| Check | Limit | Action if exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| `text_prompt` length | 3,000 characters | Trim redundant descriptions, shorten stage directions |
| Target duration | 120 seconds max per call | Split into multiple calls and chain via TA2A |
| Output format | MP3 at 24000 Hz recommended | WAV at 44100 Hz can exceed the 10 MB artifact limit |
| Non-English dialogue | Content safety filter may reject | See [Multilingual and Taglish guidance](SKILL.md#multilingual-and-taglish-guidance) |
| Reference audio | Not needed for T2A | Omit `audio_references` and all `<<TGT_SPKN>>` tags |

**Format recommendation**: Always use `mp3` at `24000` Hz for commercials. A
100-second WAV at 44100 Hz is ~18 MB and exceeds the 10 MB artifact store limit;
the same clip as MP3 at 24000 Hz is ~800 KB.

### Step 5 — Generate

Before calling the tool, write the immutable exact prompt snapshot beside the
planned output and record its SHA-256, ordered references, parameters, model,
operation ID, request hash, and `submission_status: prepared` in `task_ids.json`.
Obtain a complete prompt-review result for that exact request. Persist each
variation as its own operation before submission. Then mark the operation
`submitting` and call `seed_audio_generate` with the composed prompt:

```python
seed_audio_generate(
    input={
        "text_prompt": <composed_prompt>,
        "output": {
            "format": "mp3",
            "sample_rate": 24000,
            "subtitle": True,
            "subtitle_type": "utterance"
        },
        "persist": True
    }
)
```

For multiple takes, use `seed_audio_generate_variations` with
`variation_prompts` (up to 5 parallel variations). Each variation is an
independent generation — partial failures are captured per variation.

**Timeouts**: A local timeout is unavailable completion evidence. Preserve the
prepared request and set `submission_status: submission_unknown` when acceptance
cannot be established. Record any provider task/request ID immediately. Reconcile
through provider status, artifact lookup, or support using the operation and
request evidence. With a known task ID, resume polling that task. Without an ID,
keep the operation unresolved; elapsed time does not establish non-acceptance.
Do not resubmit automatically or switch transport to repeat the request. A new
operation requires terminal/non-acceptance evidence or explicit user authorization
that acknowledges the unresolved prior request and duplicate-cost risk.

**Content safety rejections**: The provider runs an audio risk audit on the
generated output. If a chunk is rejected (`decision_in_reject_list`), the
entire generation fails with `code=55001310`. See
[Multilingual and Taglish guidance](SKILL.md#multilingual-and-taglish-guidance) for
mitigation strategies.

### Step 6 — Download and verify

After generation succeeds:

1. **Download** the audio from the `source_url` to the project asset path.
2. **Verify with ffprobe** — record duration, format, sample rate, channels,
   bit rate, and file size.
3. **Full decode check** — run `ffmpeg -v error -i <file> -f null -` to confirm
   no decode errors.
4. **SHA-256** — compute and record the hash; verify it matches the artifact
   record.
5. **Verify the prepared snapshot** — retain the pre-submission prompt file and
   confirm its SHA-256 still matches the request; add output metadata only.

### Step 7 — Save manifests

Create or update these project files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `projects/<project>/project.md` | Brief, cast, locations, model defaults, status |
| `projects/<project>/scenes/scene-01/scene.md` | Scene definition, story, assets table |
| `projects/<project>/scenes/scene-01/s01_sh010/shot.md` | Generation details, output, cost, prompt ref, notes |
| `projects/<project>/scenes/scene-01/prompt_mix_s01_v<NN>.md` | Immutable prompt snapshot beside the audio asset |

The prompt snapshot lives **beside the media asset it produced, nowhere
else.** Use the `prompt_` prefix followed by the audio asset name (without
extension). For a scene-level commercial mix: `prompt_mix_s01_v01.md` beside
`mix_s01_v01.mp3`. For shot-level dialogue:
`prompt_dlg_s01_sh010_<character-id>_t01_v01.md` beside
`dlg_s01_sh010_<character-id>_t01_v01.mp3`.

### Step 8 — Present for review

Present the result to the user with:
- The local file path
- Duration and format
- The story arc summary (one line per act)
- Key dialogue lines
- Any issues encountered (safety filter, format, etc.)
- Cost estimate

Set the manifest `status` to `review`. Only explicit user approval sets it to
`approved`.

## Multilingual and Taglish guidance

Seed Audio supports multilingual synthesis. A moderation error is a provider
rejection, not proof that a language, phrase, or cultural term is unsafe or that
the classifier made a false positive. Save the provider code, request/task ID,
reported reason, and available evidence without inventing a cause.

Review the actual content and rights context. Correct a legitimate issue with a
recorded change contract, or use the provider's support/appeal path when the
reason is unclear. Preserve the user's requested language unless a translation
is explicitly requested or agreed. Rephrasing to disguise content or bypass a
filter is not a remediation strategy. A new authorized attempt gets a new
operation record, reviewed prompt snapshot, and cost estimate; no wording
promises a guaranteed pass.

## Cost management

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `seed-audio-1.0` |
| Pricing | $0.15/min ($0.0025/second) |
| Billing basis | `original_duration` (pre-processed) |
| Max duration per call | 120 seconds |
| Typical 100s commercial | ~$0.25 |
| Typical 120s commercial | ~$0.30 |
| 3-take iteration | ~$0.75 |

**Cost-saving tips:**
- Prototype with shorter prompts first (60–80s) to validate the story arc
  before generating the full-length version.
- Use `seed_audio_generate_variations` for parallel takes — it's the same
  total cost as sequential calls but faster.
- Each content-safety rejection still bills for the generation attempt (the
  audio is generated before the audit rejects it). Validate multilingual
  prompts carefully before submitting.
- Set `DAILY_BUDGET_USD` on the MCP server to enforce a hard daily limit.
