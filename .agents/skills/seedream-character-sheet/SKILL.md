# Seedream Character Sheet

Write production-grade prompts for BytePlus Seedream character-sheet generation.
This skill is specifically for **identity reference sheets**, not general
character portraits and not environment/location work.

Use this skill when the user wants:
- a character sheet
- a model sheet
- a turnaround-style identity sheet
- a Seedance-facing identity anchor
- a reusable `elements/<character-id>/char_<character-id>_<sheet-type>_v<NN>.png` asset

This skill is designed to partner with:
- `seedream-prompt` for general Seedream image prompting
- `seedream-character-sheet-cleanup` after generation when a full-body panel
  still shows a readable extra face
- `seedream-edit` for cleanup or local post-generation fixes

Do **not** use this skill for:
- one-off portraits
- posters or key art
- location assets
- product sheets
- environment stills

## Default production rule

For project character sheets, default to a **three-panel** layout unless the
user explicitly asks for more angles:

1. **Back full-body**
2. **Front full-body**
3. **Face close-up**

Use a **neutral gray** studio background and **neutral, even studio lighting**
by default. Lighting never changes to fit a scene or mood — character sheets
are identity references, not scene stills. The sheet lighting stays neutral
unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

## Why this layout

This layout is optimized for downstream identity consistency:
- the back view preserves costume, silhouette, hair, and headwear logic
- the front full-body view preserves stance and overall costume read
- the close-up panel acts as the canonical face anchor

Compared with a five-view turnaround, this structure is simpler, easier to
read, and more stable for later Seedance and Seedream reference use.

## Flexible prompt structure

Use this order for the sections that apply. Do not add empty boilerplate:

- **References** only when images are provided
- **Task** when the mode needs clarification
- **Subject** and **Composition** for every character sheet
- **Setting**, **Style**, and **Lighting** when they add relevant direction
- **Text in image** only when labels or other readable text are requested
- **Constraints** only for useful quality, continuity, and exclusion requirements

## 1. References (when provided)

List every reference image the user provides.

```text
References:
@Image 1: character face or approved identity reference
@Image 2: wardrobe or costume reference
@Image 3: style or film still reference
```

Rules:
- Omit the References section when no images are provided.
- If an approved character sheet already exists, use it as `@Image 1` for
  continuity.
- If the user has a preferred costume or hair reference, separate those by role
  rather than blending them ambiguously into one description.
- Bind every reference again where it affects the output: for example, “Use the
  identity and facial traits from @Image 1,” “use the wardrobe from @Image 2,”
  and “use the photographic treatment from @Image 3.” A reference inventory
  alone is not sufficient.

## 2. Task type

Use **Text-to-Image (T2I)** only when the prompt uses no reference images.

Use **Image-to-Image (I2I)** whenever any reference image guides identity,
wardrobe, hair, style, composition, or another visible output property. This
includes first-pass character sheets assembled from face, costume, or style
references; it is not limited to revisions of an already-approved sheet.

## 3. Subject

Describe the person and the exact three-panel requirement.

```text
Subject:
[Character identity, age, ethnicity, facial features, hair, clothing, accessories, same person in all panels, three panels only: back full-body, front full-body, face close-up.]
```

Always include:
- an inline binding for each supplied reference in the section it controls
- age
- ethnicity / cultural identity when relevant
- 2–4 stable facial traits
- hair and headwear
- costume
- key accessories
- **a relaxed neutral expression** — the sheet is an identity reference, so the
  face must stay readable and emotionless; the model otherwise injects arbitrary
  mood (smiles, frowns, glare) that bleeds into every downstream use
- explicit statement that it is the **same person in all panels**

Signature accessories the character always wears — eyewear, a hat, a helmet,
jewelry, footwear — belong in the descriptor word for word **as part of the
outfit**, so identity and costume stay consistent across generations.

Use this canonical neutral-expression phrase verbatim in every character sheet:

```text
Relaxed neutral expression in all panels: mouth relaxed and closed, eyes looking straight into camera, no smile, no frown, no raised brows, no emotion.
```

**Never put held props in the character sheet.** Anything the character holds,
carries, aims, or operates on camera (devices, weapons, tools, bags) is a
separate canonical prop. Author a dedicated `prop_` sheet for each one and bind
it as an `@Image N` reference downstream — do not describe or show it in the
character sheet.

**Scene-variant wearables are props, not outfit.** A wearable that is not worn
in every scene (e.g. sunglasses the character wears in some scenes and removes
in others) must be **excluded from the character sheet** and generated as a
`prop_` sheet instead. Only include wearables that are always part of the look
in every scene.

## 4. Setting

The setting for character sheets is typically simple and controlled.

```text
Setting:
Clean neutral gray studio background, consistent across all three panels.
```

Default:
- neutral gray seamless background
- no props
- no held objects
- no furniture
- no environmental clutter

Only deviate if the user explicitly wants a stylized or filmic sheet background.

## 5. Style

Define the image language.

```text
Style:
[Photorealistic, cinematic, editorial, film still, grounded realism, wardrobe-reference quality.]
```

Recommended anchors:
- photorealistic
- cinematic
- naturalistic editorial reference
- grounded realism
- film-photo finish

For a realistic (non-AI-looking) sheet, add the anti-AI-look cues: documentary
editorial portrait photography, shot on a
full-frame camera with a 50mm lens, visible skin pores, fine flyaway hair,
subtle film grain, and slight facial asymmetry. Keep skin matte — never glossy —
and forbid plastic/airbrushed skin and unnatural symmetry in Constraints.

## 6. Lighting

Character sheets use **neutral, even studio lighting** — never scene-specific
lighting. Do not change the light to match the character's world or story mood;
the sheet is an identity reference, so lighting must stay flat, readable, and
identical across all panels.

```text
Lighting:
[Soft, even, neutral studio light, flat fill, no mood, no dramatic shadows, consistent across all panels.]
```

Default:
- soft studio key
- gentle even fill
- neutral white balance
- no scene mood, no color cast
- no hotspots
- no blown highlights
- no specular shine, flash, or gloss on the skin — matte skin texture, never glossy

The same neutral lighting is used for every character sheet regardless of what
lighting the scene or character's world uses.

## 7. Composition

Explicitly enforce the three-panel structure.

```text
Composition:
Three-panel character sheet with even spacing: back full-body view on the left, front full-body view in the center, face close-up on the right. Eye-level camera, consistent framing across the two body panels, relaxed neutral expression in every panel.
```

Core rules:
- three panels only
- back full-body first
- front full-body second
- frontal close-up third
- same character identity across all panels
- relaxed neutral expression across all panels, face square to camera in the close-up
- readable costume silhouette in the body panels
- close-up panel is the face authority

## 8. Text in image

Omit this section by default. Include it only when the user requests
labels or other readable text. For production character sheets, avoid text
overlays unless requested.

## 9. Constraints

Use quality + negative constraints together:

```text
Constraints:
Quality: 4K, consistent character identity across all panels
Negative: no extra panels, no side profile, no 3/4 view, no props, no held objects, no weapons, no text overlays, no watermarks, no distorted anatomy
```

Common negatives:
- no extra panels
- no profile panel
- no 3/4 panel
- no props in hands
- no held objects, weapons, or carried items
- no background variation
- no scene lighting or color cast
- no exaggerated expressions, no smiling, no frowning, no strong emotions
- no glossy skin, no specular shine or flash on the skin
- no plastic skin, no airbrushed skin, no over-smoothing, no waxy texture, no CGI sheen
- no unnatural symmetry
- no distorted hands
- no extra fingers
- no watermark

## Worked example: Film-style pirate sheet

This example mirrors the user-provided sample image in `examples/`.

```text
Task:
Text-to-Image (T2I)

Subject:
3-view character reference sheet for a film character. The same man in all three views: youthful attractive man in his early 30s, warm olive-brown skin, dark thick curly hair, thin mustache with a small soul-patch under the lip, faint stubble along the jaw, two small silver hoop earrings on the left ear, thin silver chain necklace, subtly asymmetrical face, a small subtle healed scar near the right eye. Age-of-sail pirate costume: faded mustard-yellow durag tied at the back with the tails hanging down, small shark tooth pendant attached to the durag above the left temple, open off-white linen shirt, worn dark leather vest, wide sash belt, baggy dark breeches, scuffed leather boots, weathered and dirty fabrics. Relaxed neutral expression in all panels: mouth relaxed and closed, eyes looking straight into camera, no smile, no frown, no raised brows, no emotion. Three panels only: full-body back view, full-body front view, and frontal face close-up.

Setting:
Neutral medium-gray seamless studio backdrop, consistent across all three panels, with thin subtle vertical divider lines separating the panels.

Style:
Gritty cinematic 35mm film photograph, naturalistic editorial reference, fine film grain, organic matte skin texture, never plastic CGI skin.

Lighting:
Very soft, even, neutral studio light, flat fill, neutral white balance, no mood, no dramatic shadows, no hotspots, no blown highlights, identical lighting across all three panels.

Composition:
Three panels side by side in a single horizontal row. Left panel: full-body back view. Center panel: full-body front view. Right panel: frontal close-up portrait from the chest up, face square to camera, relaxed neutral expression. Consistent identity, costume, scar, accessories, proportions, and lighting across all panels.

Constraints:
Quality: 16:9 horizontal sheet, film-photo finish, consistent identity across all panels
Negative: no extra panels, no 3/4 view, no profile view, no props, no missing limbs, no prosthesis, no glossy skin, no exaggerated expressions, no smiling, no frowning, no strong emotions, no watermarks, no text overlays
```

## Workflow pairing

Recommended sequence:
1. Use this skill to write the character-sheet prompt.
2. Generate the sheet with Seedream.
3. Inspect the body panels for extra readable faces.
4. If needed, optionally compose with `seedream-character-sheet-cleanup`.
5. Save each generated result under `elements/<character-id>/` beside `character.md`.
6. Record the approved filename as `selected_variant` in `character.md`; keep reference images in the same element folder using the `ref_<NN>_...` convention.

## Example asset

The user-provided sample image is stored beside this skill:
- `examples/pirate-character-sheet-generated-sample.png`

Use it as a visual target for layout and panel balance, not as a literal
identity reference unless the user explicitly asks for that specific character.
Note: the sample was generated with a moodier, low-key film look that predates
the current neutral-gray-background / neutral-lighting default; do not copy its
lighting into new sheets.
