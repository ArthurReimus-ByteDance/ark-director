description: Write structured Seedream 5.0 Pro/Lite image generation prompts with input reference labeling, subject definitions, style and composition control, interactive image editing (local edits, sketch rendering, layer separation, multi-image fusion, color/material replacement), high-density infographics, sequential generation, and constraints. Invoke when the user asks to generate a Seedream prompt, write an image prompt, create infographics, edit images, or design posters/UI/branding assets with BytePlus image generation.

# Seedream Prompt

Write production-grade prompts for BytePlus Seedream 5.0 Pro (`dola-seedream-5-0-pro-260628`) and Seedream 5.0 Lite. Seedream 5.0 Pro is a multimodal image creation model that goes beyond generation — it understands design intent, supports interactive precision editing, produces high-density infographics, natively renders text in 14 languages, and delivers cinematic realism with accurate lighting and materials.


## Input and output contract

Input: image purpose, visible detail, exact required copy, model, size, and ordered input roles.

Output: an image-generation or edit prompt and its matching reference bindings.

## Procedure and reference loading

Use image-generation for new images and image-editing for edits. Add photographic-detail only when a photographic look is wanted. Worked examples are optional patterns, never automatic instructions to change identity or approval state.

Read only the mode-specific resources needed for the request. Reference paths
mentioned in prose are relative to this skill directory unless a link says otherwise.

- [Image Generation](references/image-generation.md) — Recommended prompt structure — Image generation.
- [Image Editing](references/image-editing.md) — Recommended prompt structure — Image Editing.
- [Worked Examples](references/worked-examples.md) — Full example: T2I — Cinematic scene; Full example: Infographic; Full example: Image Editing — Color & Material Replacement; Full example: Multi-image fusion.
- [Photographic Detail](references/photographic-detail.md) — Avoiding the AI look.
- [Quick Reference](references/quick-reference.md) — Quick reference card.

## Submission boundary and failure behavior

The caller owns production authorization, the exact request preflight, and the
complete hash-bound prompt review. A leaf returns its prompt package without
loading sibling skills. An explicitly declared orchestrator may coordinate the
review and submission stages. Missing required inputs remain unresolved; a draft
or technical success does not establish user approval. Preserve optional timing,
the three-image sampling default where applicable, and the requested delta.

## Evidence and creative advice

Distinguish four kinds of guidance when they affect a decision: **API requirement**
(verify with the selected live tool and its current source), **documented prompting
convention** (attribute to the linked guide), **observed result** (identify the
actual artifact, model and conditions), and **optional artistic technique**
(a hypothesis or choice to test). Model/price tables are reference snapshots,
not live capability evidence. Examples without linked result evidence are
hypothetical; do not describe them as proven improvements. Keep these labels in
reasoning or evaluation notes when useful, not boilerplate in every final prompt.

## Source authority

The prompt structure and rules in this skill are sourced from:
- [Seedream 5.0 Pro official blog](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/blog/beyond-generation-it-understands-design-introducing-seedream-5-0-pro) (2026-07-08)
- [Seedream 4.0-5.0 API Tutorial](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1824121)
- [Seedream 4.0-4.5 Prompt Guide](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/1829186)
- Seedream 5.0 Pro User Manual (Lark wiki, internal)

When the official guide is updated, prefer the live page over this skill where they conflict.

## Character-sheet routing

For character sheets, identity sheets, turnaround sheets, or Seedance-facing
character references, prefer the sibling `seedream-character-sheet` skill rather
than embedding that workflow here.

If the generated character sheet later needs duplicate-face cleanup, optionally
compose with the companion `seedream-character-sheet-cleanup` skill.

## Usage tips

### Prompt formula
**Subject > Setting > Style > Lighting > Composition > Technical** is a readability convention. Lead with the requested result and omit irrelevant sections; do not claim a measured positional weighting law.

### Prompt length
- Recommended: 30-100 words for standard images.
- Infographics and complex scenes can go longer but stay focused.

### Use detail that changes the image
- Clearly describe subject appearance, state, motion, expression, and attire.
- Use style keywords to define artistic direction.
- Describe light direction, quality (hard/soft), color tone, and time of day.
- Specify shot type, viewing angle, and composition method.
- For multi-image fusion, style transfer, and outfit transfer, uploading reference images improves fidelity.

### Break complex tasks into steps
For multi-element composition or fine editing, step-by-step operation improves controllability.

### What Seedream 5.0 Pro is good at
- Precise local editing through interactive controls
- Multi-image fusion of objects, styles, and materials
- High-density information visualization (data, text, concepts into images)
- Design productivity: posters, presentations, branding, e-commerce assets
- Multilingual text: 14 languages with accurate character structures
- Cinematic imagery: high-fidelity narrative scenes and portrait retouching

### What Seedream 5.0 Pro is not suited for
- Fully replacing professional designer judgment
- Highly complex layouts requiring precise typographic control
- Generating non-compliant or infringing content
- UI design requiring pixel-level precision
- Small text may still be unstable — manual refinement after generation is recommended
