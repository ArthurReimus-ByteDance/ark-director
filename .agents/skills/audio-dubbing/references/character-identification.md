# Character Identification Guide

Before writing a dubbing prompt, correctly identify every speaker and assign them to dialogue lines. Getting this wrong ruins the dub.

## The process

1. **Read the target script** — all lines, all context
2. **Count distinct voices** — how many different speakers are there?
3. **Identify each speaker by role** — who are they? what do they want?
4. **Assign every line to a speaker** — no line left unassigned
5. **Verify against source** — count should match the audible number of voices
6. **Confirm with user if ambiguous** — never guess when uncertain

## Clues to identify speakers

### Direct address
- "Ms. Ford" → speaker is NOT Ms. Ford; they are addressing her
- "Lucy" → speaker is NOT Lucy
- "Mr. Dawson" → speaker is NOT Mr. Dawson

### Third-person references
- "my grandson / apo ko" → speaker is a grandparent
- "your client" → speaker is addressing someone who represents a client (a lawyer, agent, etc.)
- "his decision" → speaker is talking about someone else

### First-person references
- "I want to talk to your client" → speaker is not the lawyer; they are the client's counterpart
- "my health is failing" → speaker is an older person
- "I'll wait for him to return" → speaker is someone who was meeting with him

### Formal vs casual register
- Formal title + last name ("Mr. Dawson," "Ms. Ford") → professional context, likely a lawyer or official
- First name ("Lucy," "Vincent") → personal relationship, family or close acquaintance

### Emotional tone
- Calm, measured, procedural → lawyer / professional
- Warm, pleading, emotional → family member
- Defiant, composed, resolute → protagonist / main character

## Speaker mapping template

When you've identified all speakers, record them like this:

```
Speaker A — [full role description] — [N] lines (lines: X, Y, Z...)
Speaker B — [full role description] — [N] lines (lines: ...)
Speaker C — [full role description] — [N] lines (lines: ...)

Total: [N] lines across [M] speakers.
```

## Common pitfall: alternating speakers in a debate

When two characters go back and forth (e.g., lawyer vs. family member arguing about a marriage), it's easy to mix up who has which line. Always trace the argument:

1. Who opens? (line 1)
2. Who responds? (line 2)
3. Who pushes back? (line 3)
4. Who counters? (line 4)
5. etc.

If a line makes more sense in the other speaker's voice, double-check.

## When to use Seed 2.1 for help

If the script is complex, ambiguous, or in a language you don't fully understand, use Seed 2.1 multimodal understanding to analyze the script. Call the `seed_understand` MCP tool with the script text in the `prompt` field. The model ID is `dola-seed-2-1-turbo-260628` (or the configured default). Enable `thinking: true` for complex scripts that require reasoning about character motivations.

```
Analyze this drama dialogue script about [brief context].
Identify each speaker based on context, who is being addressed,
and who is speaking. There are [N] distinct speakers.

For EACH line, tell me: line number, who is speaking, and a brief reason why.
```

If the speaker count is unknown, say "an unknown number of distinct speakers" and ask the model to count them and identify each one.

This is especially useful for:
- Scripts with many characters (5+)
- Languages you don't speak
- Complex scenes with rapid back-and-forth
- Scenes where it's unclear if a line is narration or dialogue

## Validation checklist

- [ ] Every line has a speaker assigned
- [ ] Speaker count matches the number of distinct voices in the source
- [ ] Each speaker's lines form a coherent character (consistent motivation, tone)
- [ ] Line-by-line alternation makes narrative sense
- [ ] No unintentional third-person self-references (unless illeism is an established character trait)
- [ ] If in doubt, confirmed with the user
