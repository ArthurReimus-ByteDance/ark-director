# ark-director

> An AI director workspace that orchestrates BytePlus / Volcano Engine generative models — **Seedance** (video), **Seedream** (images), and **Seed Audio** (audio) — to turn prompts and references into finished content assets.

> Pair this workspace with the partner [`byteplus-sa/modelark-mcp`](https://github.com/byteplus-sa/modelark-mcp) server and consult the [ModelArk console docs](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ap-southeast-1/docs/ModelArk/2536875?lang=en) to maximize capabilities.

`ark-director` behaves like an "AI director": it composes multiple BytePlus model families into end-to-end content pipelines. The primary integration mechanism is **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** plus **agent skills**:

- **MCP servers** wrap the BytePlus ModelArk REST API and expose narrowly-scoped, composable tools.
- **Agent skills** are higher-level content-creation recipes that compose those MCP tools into end-to-end pipelines (e.g. "short ad spot", "storyboard to video", "podcast intro").

Agents prefer MCP for durable generation and Ark CLI for platform administration or interactive generation. Equivalent CLI fallback preserves the same review, persistence, and reconciliation contract. Skills never call the Ark REST API directly.

## Model catalog

Models are accessed through **BytePlus ModelArk** and the BytePlus Seed Speech surface. Credentials are resolved from the environment at runtime: `BYTEPLUS_MODELARK_API_KEY` for Seedream and Seedance, and `BYTEPLUS_SEED_AUDIO_API_KEY` for Seed Audio.

| Family | Model(s) | Modality | Key capabilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seedance | **Seedance 2.5** (`dreamina-seedance-2-5-260628`, default) — up to 30s/pass, 1080p, 30 imgs / 10 vids / 10 audio refs. Seedance 2.0 (`dreamina-seedance-2-0-260128`) as fallback for 4K / Fast / Mini. | Video | Text-to-video, first/last-frame, multimodal references, editing, extension, native audio+video |
| Seedream | Seedream 5.0 Pro (`dola-seedream-5-0-pro-260628`); configured Lite/4.x bindings | Image | Text-to-image, reference-based generation/editing, multi-reference fusion, sequential output |
| Seed Audio | Seed Audio 1.0 (`seed-audio-1.0`) | Audio | Voice + music + SFX + ambience in one pass, multi-character dialogue, voice references, cross-lingual generation |
| Seed / Doubao | `seed-2-0-lite-260228` and siblings | Text | Prompt expansion, scene scripting, structured output |

```

- MCP tools submit an Ark task, poll until completion, download the resulting asset to the relevant `projects/<project>/scenes/...` path, and return both the local file path and the asset URL.
- **Always save generated files locally.** Element assets live under `elements/`, shot outputs under `scenes/`, and reusable non-shot media under `library/`. Provider URIs supplement the local copy.
- The Seed LLM is used inside skills for prompt expansion and scene scripting, not as a content generator itself.

**Naming conventions:** lowercase kebab-case for all folders and ids. Structured token prefixes (`s01_sh010_t01_v01.mp4`, `char_gloria_turnaround_v01.png`) make generated files self-describing, sortable, and parseable.

## Production workflow

`ark-director` treats expensive media generation as a gated production workflow:

1. **Brief & creative locks** — record approved identities, environments, props, tone, resolution, duration, audio mode.
2. **Reference preflight** — classify each asset (visible identity, environment, motion reference, control-only). The ordered reference array submitted must match the `references:` list in `shot.md` exactly.
3. **Spatial & temporal preflight** — record start, travel axis, subject order, boundary behavior, end state for movement-heavy scenes.
4. **Audio for dialogue (optional)** — when the user requests lip-synced dialogue, generate the Seed Audio track first, then use it as `reference_audio` to Seedance.
5. **Low-cost prototype** — validate motion, geography, camera at the lowest suitable resolution.
6. **Creative review** — preserve approved decisions; write the single requested delta plus acceptance criteria for the next take.
7. **Final candidate** — increase resolution only after creative behavior is approved.
8. **Technical & semantic QA** — inspect actual streams, decode integrity, contact sheets, key transitions, audio.

**Generate per scene at its natural duration (4–30s), not per 30-second block.** Chain approved scenes via `return_last_frame` / `first_frame` + a shared reference bundle and assemble in post.

---

## Production rules

Draft breakdown identifies required canon. Approve recurring, branded, or story-critical references before dependent generation. Static sheets use visible-design checks; narrative shots use action and intent. Reference images anchor screen layout, with actual output checked for text fidelity.

Only explicit user choice selects or approves an asset. Freeze exact requests before submission, retain provider IDs, and reconcile unknown acceptance rather than retrying automatically. Default image selection sets retain three equivalent stochastic samples.

The tracked [production policy](.agents/contracts/production-policy.md), [routing](.agents/contracts/routing.md), [element contract](.agents/contracts/element-identification.md), and [naming rules](.agents/contracts/asset-naming.md) contain the operational details. Root [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the entrypoint.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- An AI coding agent runtime that supports MCP servers and agent skills (e.g. [opencode](https://opencode.ai), Claude Code, or similar).
- A BytePlus ModelArk account with API access.
- Environment variables:

```bash
BYTEPLUS_MODELARK_API_KEY=your_modelark_key      # Seedream + Seedance
BYTEPLUS_SEED_AUDIO_API_KEY=your_seed_audio_key  # Seed Audio
# Optional: region override (default: ap-southeast-1)
# ARK_BASE_URL=https://ark.ap-southeast.bytepluses.com/api/v3
```

### Quick start

1. **Clone the repo** and open it in your agent-compatible editor.
2. **Set the environment variables** above in a `.env` file (gitignored).
3. **Start a project** — create `projects/<your-project>/project.md` with your brief, cast, and locations.
4. **Build Elements** — use the `seedream-*` skills to generate canonical character, location, and prop sheets under `elements/`.
5. **Break into scenes and shots** — write `scene.md` and `shot.md` manifests.
6. **Generate** — use the `seedance-*` and `seed-audio-*` skills to author prompts, then submit via the MCP tools.
7. **Assemble** — use the `ffmpeg-*` skills to concatenate approved takes with crossfades and mix audio.
8. **Review** — use the `showcase-html` skill to review generated assets in-browser (use `--quick <file paths>` for ad-hoc comparison, or full `showcase.json` for project-wide review with synchronized playback, contact sheets, and pick-winner selection).

## Skill sources

Skills in this workspace come from three sources, tracked in `skills-lock.json`:

| Source | Type | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Project-authored** | `local` | All `seedance-*`, `seedream-*`, `seed-audio-*`, `film-production`, `template-factory`, `brief-intake`, `prompt-review`, `media-review`, `tig-*`, `ugc-ad-modes`, `ffmpeg-scene-transitions`, `ffmpeg-side-by-side-comparison`, `modelark-mcp`, `lark-showcase-aigc`, `showcase-html`, `color-grade-palettes`, `blender-to-seedance` |
| **Remotion (vendored)** | `github: remotion-dev/skills` | `remotion-*` (9 skills), `mediabunny` |
| **Blender (vendored)** | `github: ra100/blender-claude-plugin` | `blender-*` (8 skills) |
| **FFmpeg (vendored)** | `github: digitalsamba/claude-code-video-toolkit` | `ffmpeg` |

Vendored skills are upstream-owned and excluded from the skill-isolation
remediation — their cross-skill directives are treated as upstream design (see
`AGENTS.md`). Project-authored skills follow the global "Skill Independence &
Orchestration" rule: one capability per skill, prose-only "compose with X"
sibling hints, and explicitly-marked orchestrators.

## Conventions

- **Secrets:** Load all API keys, base URLs, and regions from environment variables or a gitignored `.env`. Never hard-code credentials.
- **Watermark:** `watermark: false` by default for all image, video, and audio generation. Enable only when explicitly requested.
- **Cost guardrails:** Default to the lowest-cost/fast variant for development and tests; gate expensive runs behind explicit flags.
- **Reproducibility:** Every project, element, scene, and shot carries a Markdown manifest with YAML frontmatter recording model, prompt, references, seed, params, cost, and status. A later agent must be able to re-create any asset from its manifest alone.
- **Local-first:** The `projects/`, `docs/`, `plans/`, and `specs/` trees are local-only working state — never committed to git. Generated media is gitignored by pattern.

## License

This is an internal workspace. See the repository for license details.

## Offline maintenance checks

Install the locked Python tooling with `uv sync --locked`. Run `uv run python .agents/scripts/validate_workspace.py --offline`, `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, and the scoped lint/type commands in AGENTS.md. These checks never submit provider generations.

For uncommitted changes, supply `--inventory <prospective-files.json>` to validate the exact intended tracked file set without staging it. The validator otherwise uses `git ls-files`, so missing/untracked runtime dependencies fail rather than relying on local-only documents. Browser/media smoke tests use synthetic fixtures; paid provider checks are separate and explicitly scoped.

Catalog descriptions and installed bundle hashes live in `.agents/catalog/`. Review source changes before refreshing integrity. Upstream commit revisions missing from legacy lock entries remain explicitly unknown.

### Creative-quality evaluation

For skill-quality comparisons, use the semantic protocol in
[Creative Quality](.agents/skills/prompt-review/references/creative-quality.md).
The offline `evaluate_skill_quality.py` helper anonymizes paired writer outputs
and aggregates complete, evidence-backed judgments. It does not generate media
or infer quality from matching headings. Preserve ties, regressions and the
distinction between prompt judgments and observed media results.
